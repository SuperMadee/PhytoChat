Citrus fruits \r\nare very common and the most important fruit crops in India, and are grown \r\nin 9.85 lakh hectares with a total production of 114.19 lakh tons. Low \r\nproductivity in citrus is caused by many factors such as, plant pathogens, \r\ninsect-pests, nutritional imbalances, and physiological disorders. However, \r\nthe world production of citrus fruits is faced with several constraints which \r\nhinder its development. Furthermore, the spread of pests such as mealybugs, \r\nmites, and Mediterranean fruit fly has impacted negatively on citrus quality \r\nand yield. Therefore, the main objectives of this review were to identify the \r\nkey harmful organisms to the citrus crops and to highlight the appropriate \r\nmethods to manage them.\r\n8.1 INTRODUCTION \r\nThe citrus fruits include lemons, orange limes, tangerines, pomelo, and \r\ngrapefruit.

Compound flavonoids have anticancer effects.\r\nCitrus fruits are very common and the most important fruit crops in India, \r\nand are grown in 9.85 lakh hectares with a total production of 114.19 lakh \r\ntons (Anonymous, 2017a). Low productivity in citrus is due to many factors \r\nsuch as pathogens, insect-pests, nutritional imbalances, physiological disor\u0002ders, and improper cultural practices. Citrus fruits growing countries are \r\nBrazil, Cuba, Israel, Japan, Morocco, Spain, South Africa, Turkey, USA, and \r\nIndia in the world. India ranks sixth in the worldwide production of citrus \r\nfruits. After mango and banana production, citrus fruits occupy third place in \r\nproduction in India. Citrus fruits originated in Southeast Asia's tropical and \r\nsubtropical areas, essentially India and China. Northeast India is the native \r\nsite of numerous citrus plants. Citrus fruits hit with a high content of vitamin \r\nC and a refreshing drink. India grows and produces several commercially \r\nimportant citrus fruits, such as orange (mandarin or santra), sweet orange \r\n(mosambi, malta, or satgudi), lime, and lemon (Anonymous, 2012). \r\nCitrus plants are very liable to infestation many diseases, these are as \r\ngiven below:\r\nDiseases\r\n(1) Gummosis: Phytophthora parasitica, P. palmivora, P. citrophthora\r\n(2) Scab/Verucosis: Elsinoe fawcetti Sphaceloma fawcettii (anamorph)\r\n(3) Canker: Xanthomonas campestris pv citri\r\n(4) Tristeza or fast decay: Citrus tristeza virus (CTV)\r\n(5) Huanglongbing/Citrus greening: Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus\r\n8.2 GUMMOSIS: PHYTOPHTHORA SPP. \r\nIntroduction/Economic Importance:\r\nThere are six Phytophthora spp. capable of causing disease in citrus fruit trees, \r\nbut the greatest reduction in fruit yield may be attributed to the following two \r\nspp.: (1) Phytophthora parasitica Dast. (mostly in tropical and subtropical \r\nregions), (2) Phytophthora citrophthora (R.E. Srn. and E.H. Srn.) Leonian \r\n(mostly in temperate climates; Timmer and Menge, 1988). Phytophthora spp. \r\nhas a back history as a major constraint in citrus fruit production throughout \r\nthe world. Gummosis or Phytophthora disease occurred and reported from \r\nAustralia in 1860 and later in Florida in 1952 (Broadbent, 1977).

In areas with rainfall to \r\nprovide favorable temperature and high humidity, the disease is prevalent. \r\nApart from that, disease that occurs on a new flush and fruit setting coincides \r\nwith warm and humid weather. The disease often occurs when planting citrus \r\nin warm, low-lying soils and dense or shaded conditions. Serious outbreaks \r\nof citrus scab disease only occur in areas where susceptible species or \r\ncultivars of citrus fruits are produced. Yield losses often rely on seasonal \r\nand local weather variations. In which areas where annual rainfall is limited \r\n(<1300 mm) the disease is not an issue.

The \r\nlesions on the leaf are initially semitranslucent dots that become tiny nipple\u0002like projections with pale yellow cream. Lesions can go up by as much as \r\n3 mm in diameter and grow a scab-like appearance.

Fungal spores are distrib\u0002uted by splashes of rain, overhead irrigation, and spray operations. Dew may\r\nalso cause the spores to be released from the lesions but due to the inhibited \r\nsplashing action, only localized dispersal may occur (Whiteside, 1975).\r\nFavorable Conditions:\r\nCitrus scab disease can be especially serious on flushes from summer \r\ndevelopment.

The \r\ndisease affects all of the important crops of citrus fruits in that region. The \r\ndisease causes tremendous losses to the citrus, and along with cultivars and \r\nthe prevailing climate, the severity of the disease varies.

In arid \r\ncitrus growing areas, canker usually does not occur. However, the occur\u0002rence of the disease worldwide in many areas is a continuous threat to citrus \r\nfruit production, particularly in canker-free zones. Citrus canker disease in \r\nIndia appears to be a serious problem wherever acid lime (C. aurantifolia) is \r\ngrown on a large and commercial scale and has become a major permanent \r\nproblem for citrus growers. In 1942, Luthra and Sattar first reported Citrus \r\ncanker disease from Punjab (Luthra and Sattar, 1942; Bedi, 1961). In 1954, \r\nRamakrishan further recorded the occurrence of citrus canker disease in \r\nTamil Nadu (Ramakrishnan, 1954). Canker has also been reported from the \r\nPunjab at kinnow, mandarin nursery (Anonymous, 2000). \r\nFIGURE 8.4 Citrus canker disease (a) Citrus canker symptoms on sour leaves; (b) Citrus \r\ncanker symptoms on citrus fruits. \r\nApple Academic Press Author Copy Non Commercial Use\n"
