While some citrus species\r\nhave nucellar embryony, most cultivation of citrus has been by clonal propagation to\r\nensure that propagated plants have the same traits as the parent selection. Clonal prop\u0002agation also avoids juvenility, and the propagated plants produce fruit sooner. Because\r\nof the clonal propagation of citrus, citrus has accumulated a large number of viruses;\r\nmany of these viruses are asymptomatic until a susceptible rootstock and/or scion is\r\nencountered. The viruses reported to occur in citrus will be summarized in this review.\r\nMethods of therapy to clean selected clones from viruses will be reviewed; the use of\r\nquarantine, clean stock, and certification programs for control of citrus viruses and other\r\nstrategies to control insect spread citrus viruses, such as mild strain cross-protection and\r\nthe use of pest management areas will be discussed.\r\n1. INTRODUCTION\r\nCitrus and its relatives are native to Southeast Asia, New Caledonia,\r\nand Australia (Webber, Reuther, & Lawton, 1967). Citrus has been culti\u0002vated for hundreds of years and moved around the world, as seed and prop\u0002agation materials, without regard to what viruses may be present until\r\nrelatively recently. As a result, citrus probably has many more virus and\r\nvirus-like diseases as compared to other commodities.\r\nCitrus is clonally propagated (Swingle & Reese, 1967). There are several\r\nreasons for this. While some citrus species have nucellar embryony, and\r\nseedlings are genetically the same as the parent tree, seedling citrus plants\r\nexpress juvenility traits that are undesirable: excessive thorniness, upright\r\ngrowth, and lack of flower/fruit production for several years. Clonal prop\u0002agation avoids juvenility and ensures that propagated plants will grow and\r\nproduce fruit genetically like the original tree used as the source of buds.\r\nCitrus is normally grown on a rootstock. Research and experience has\r\nshown that rootstocks can influence the quality of fruit, tree size, and impart\r\na level of tolerance to root rots, high water tables, and poor soil type\r\n(Castle, 1995).\r\nMany citrus viruses occur as latent infections in some scions, or cultivars,\r\nbut express symptoms when the cultivar is propagated on a susceptible root\u0002stock or scion/rootstock combination. For example tristeza decline is not\r\nexpressed when trees are grown on rough lemon rootstock, but when the\r\ntrees are propagated on sour orange rootstock, decline and eventually death\r\nof the tree occurs. Many \u201cold-line\u201d bud sources are infected with multiple\r\n144 Richard F. Lee\r\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n"

An example is psorosis disease\r\nwhich may not produce symptoms in the scion until the tree is from 5 to\r\n12 years old (Roistacher, 1991).\r\nIn this review, the frequently encountered virus diseases of citrus will be\r\nbriefly summarized with emphasis on their characteristics and properties\r\nwhich influence detection and their control. This is followed by a review\r\nof the control methods/strategies for citrus viruses.\r\n2. COMMONLY ENCOUNTERED CITRUS VIRUSES\r\nAND GRAFT-TRANSMISSIBLE DISEASES\r\n2.1. Citrus tristeza virus\r\nCitrus tristeza virus (CTV) is probably the most economically important virus\r\ndisease of citrus in the world, having killed more than 50 million trees on\r\nsour orange rootstock, beginning with the epidemic in Argentina and Brazil\r\nin the 1930s (Lee, Baker, & Rocha-Pena, 1994). CTV is a member of the\r\nclosterovirus group, having a flexuous filament about 2000 by 12 nm in size,\r\nwith a positive-sense RNA genome of about 20 kb, containing 12 open\r\nreading frames and two untranslated regions (Dawson, 2010). The virus is\r\ntransmitted in a semi-persistent manner by a number of aphid species, with\r\nAphis gossypii and Toxoptera citricida being the most important. A. gossypii is\r\nthe most common vector in area where T. citricida is not yet present, such as\r\nIsrael, the Mediterranean basin and the near East, and Texas, Arizona, and\r\nCalifornia (Rocha-Pen\u02dca et al., 1995). In citrus producing areas where\r\nT. citricida has been introduced, the severity of CTV has increased\r\n(Halbert et al., 2004; Rocha-Pen\u02dca et al., 1995).\r\nCTV expresses a number of biological activities: decline on sour orange\r\nrootstock, seedling yellows in lemon and grapefruit, stem pitting on grape\u0002fruit and/or sweet orange. While the decline on sour orange symptom of\r\nCTV can be overcome by planting on CTV-tolerant rootstocks, the stem\r\npitting activity is much more difficult to control. The stem pitting symptom\r\nof CTV is readily apparent in susceptible hosts, but the decline on sour\r\nstrains and seedling yellows strains are latent in most varieties and cultivars,\r\nand become apparent only when propagated on susceptible rootstocks or in\r\ngrapefruit or lemon varieties, respectively. Seedling yellows strains are\r\nalmost always accompanied by decline on sour orange and/or stem pitting\r\nactivities. Biological indexing is required to determine the biological activity\r\nControl of Virus Diseases of Citrus 145\r\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n"

        "html": "of a specific CTV isolate. The biological indexing procedure has been stan\u0002dardized to include a battery of five indicator plants: Mexican lime as a sen\u0002sitive universal indicator; sweet orange on sour orange rootstock to monitor\r\nfor decline on sour orange; Duncan grapefruit seedlings to monitor for stem\r\npitting on grapefruit; Madame vinous sweet orange seedlings to monitor for\r\nstem pitting on sweet orange; and sour orange as an indicator for seedling\r\nyellows (Garnsey, Barrett, & Hutchison, 1987; Garnsey, Gumpf, et al.,\r\n1987; Garnsey et al., 2005). Seedling yellows may also be detected on the\r\nDuncan grapefruit seedling indicators.\r\nQuarantine, clean stock, and citrus certification programs are effective in\r\npreventing the introduction of new isolates of CTV into a citrus area, and in\r\nminimizing the spread of severe CTV isolates within a citrus area. In areas\r\nwhere stem pitting strains of CTV are not present, tristeza decline on sour\r\norange may be controlled by the use of CTV tolerant rootstocks, such as\r\nPoncirus trifoliata and hybrids with P. trifoliata as one of the parents.When stem\r\npitting strains of CTV are present, mild strain cross-protection (MSCP) has\r\nbeen shown to be a useful management strategy in Brazil, Australia, and\r\nJapan (Lee & Keremane, 2013; Roistacher, da Grac\u00b8a, & Muller, 2010 \u20ac ). In\r\nCalifornia, large pest management areas for eradiation or suppression of\r\ntristeza have been established where citrus is surveyed on a regular basis,\r\nand when CTV is found, the infected trees are eradicated (Gottwald,\r\nPolek, & Riley, 2002). This has maintained CTV at very low levels in the\r\nCentral Valley of California for the past five decades. P. trifoliata is immune\r\nto most strains of CTV: this immunity gene has been identified and may be\r\nuseful in the future in developing horticulturally desirable citrus varieties\r\nwhich are immune to CTV (Garnsey, Barrett, et al., 1987; Garnsey,\r\nGumpf, et al., 1987). However, initially in New Zealand and later in other\r\ncitrus areas, isolates of CTV have been found which break the immunity\r\nshown by most isolates of CTV in P. trifoliata (Dawson & Mooney, 2000).\r\n2.2. Citrus psorosis virus (including citrus ringspot)\r\nCitrus psorosis was one of the first diseases realized to be graft transmissible\r\nand is characterized as a disease of citrus which induces bark scaling lesions\r\non the trunk and limbs of sweet orange, mandarins, and grapefruit (Fawcett,\r\n1934). The discovery that the disease could be graft transmitted to seedlings\r\nenabled the use of biological indexing to detect citrus psorosis virus (CPsV)\r\nin trees used for budwood. The ability to detect CPsV in trees led to the\r\ndevelopment of the first certification program in 1937 where budwood\r\nsource trees could be declared to be psorosis-free (Hiltabrand, 1957).\r\n146 Richard F.

        "html": "The citrus ringspot disease was first reported in the late 1960s and was char\u0002acterized by the development of localized ringspots when extracts from bark\r\nlesions from citrus were rubbed on the leaves of Chenopodium quinoa. Citrus\r\nringspot disease was once considered a different disease from psorosis, but\r\nmolecular characterization revealed that it is CPsV (Barthe, Ceccardi,\r\nManjunath, & Derrick, 1998; Roistacher, 1993). Using citrus ringspot isolates\r\nbecause of their ability to cause local lesions when inoculated onto C. quinoa, it\r\nwas realized that there were two centrifugal components of the associated virus\r\nwhen separated on sucrose density gradients, and both components were\r\nrequired for infectivity. Upon further characterization of the virus, three single\r\nstranded, negative-sense RNAs were found, with the positive strand of RNA1\r\nencoding a p24 (unknown function) and the RNA-dependent RNA poly\u0002merase (280 kDa protein); RNA2 positive strand encoding a p54 of unknown\r\nfunction, and RNA3 positive strand encoding the coat protein (CP) (48 kDa)\r\n(Barthe et al., 1998; Derrick et al., 1988). The molecular characterization rev\u0002ealed that what formerly was referred to as psorosis A (no bark scaling) and\r\npsorosis B (with bark scaling) and citrus ringspot (bark scaling and causing\r\nlocalized ringspots on C. quinoa) are all isolates of CPsV, now the type mem\u0002ber of the Ophiovirus genus (Milne, Garcia, & Grau, 2000).\r\nCPsV has a means of natural spread, but the means of natural spread has\r\nnot been identified (Roistacher, 1993). In Argentina, the natural spread of\r\nCPsV has made the virus hard to control, even when clean stock programs\r\nhave been implemented. CPsV is present in most old-line bud sources and\r\ncommonly found when testing imported germplasm for viruses. Symptoms\r\nof CPsV occur on sweet orange, mandarin, and grapefruit, although the bark\r\nscaling symptom is not displayed on trees in the field until the trees are 3\u20137\r\nyears of age, or even older. Sour orange and lemon will show symptoms on\r\nyoung leaves but usually do not show bark scaling symptoms.\r\nControl of CPsV is by use of quarantine, clean stock and certification\r\nprograms to prevent the introduction of new isolates or strains and to limit\r\ndistribution of the disease within a growing region. Because natural spread\r\ncan occur, although the means of spread is not known, foundation trees and\r\nmother trees should be re-indexed on a recurring basis (every 3\u20134 years) to\r\nensure they are free of CPsV.\r\n2.3. Concave gum disease\r\nConcave gum disease (CGD) is a disease of unknown etiology, although it\r\nis graft transmitted. CGD was first reported in 1936, and is widespread in\r\nold-line budwood (Fawcett, 1936). The disease is characterized by\r\nControl of Virus Diseases of Citrus 147\r\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n"

Upon biological indexing, oak leaf patterns and vein clearing\r\noccur in sweet orange and Sweettangor indicator plants. As with CPsV,\r\nthe control of the disease is by the use of quarantine, clean stock, and cer\u0002tification programs. In Florida, there appears to be a natural spread, especially\r\nin grapefruit (Powell, Pelosi, Sonoda, & Lee, 1998).\r\n2.4. Impietratura disease\r\nImpietratura disease is a graft transmissible disease presumably caused by\r\nan uncharacterized citrus virus (Caruso, Davino, & Terranova, 1993;\r\nRoistacher, 1991). The disease occurs in most countries in the Mediterra\u0002nean basin. The leaves of affected trees show vein clearing and oak leaf pat\u0002terns in the spring and some, but not all, of the fruit are small, malformed,\r\nand hard. The symptomatic fruit will display gum pockets in the albedo\r\nwhich appear as small bumps of the surface of the fruit. Most varieties will\r\nshow symptoms, whereas citrons appear to be more tolerant. The disease\r\nresults in fruit drop and many of the fruit are not marketable because they\r\nare malformed and hard. Upon biological indexing, the symptoms on sweet\r\norange indicator plants are similar to CPsV (Roistacher, 1991).\r\n2.5. Cristacortis disease\r\nCristacortis disease is a graft transmissible disease presumed to be caused by\r\nan uncharacterized citrus virus (Roistacher, 1991). It was first reported from\r\nCorsica (Vogel & Bove\u00b4, 1968) and has been reported also in Italy, Spain,\r\nNorthern Africa, Turkey, Mauritius, and San Paulo, Brazil. The disease is\r\ncharacterized by vertical depressions or pockets in the wood, with gumming\r\noccurring at the bottom of the depression when the bark is cut away. The\r\nsymptoms appear similar to stem pitting caused by some strains of CTV, but\r\nthe pits can occur on sour orange rootstocks, also on mandarins which tend\r\nto be more tolerant of CTV induced stem pitting. Leaf symptoms are vein\r\nflecking and oak leaf patterns, similar to those produced by CPsV. Natural\r\nspread is not reported. Quarantine, clean stock, and certification programs\r\neffectively control this disease.\r\n2.6.

        "html": "veins of sour orange (Wallace & Drake, 1953). CVEV also caused woody\r\ngalls on the trunks or rootstocks of acid lime, rough lemon, Rangpur lime,\r\nand Citrus volkameriana. The disease is transmitted in a persistent manner by\r\nseveral aphid species including T. citricida, Myzus persicae, and A. gossypii\r\n(Roistacher, 1991). The disease has been reported from Australia, California,\r\nIndia, Japan, Peru, and Spain. Using electron microscopy, spherical virus\r\nparticles about 28 nm in diameter have been visualized, leading to the sug\u0002gestion that the virus associated with citrus vein enation was a luteovirus\r\n(Maharaj & da Grac\u00b8a, 1988). Recently, an Enamovirus has been associated\r\nwith CVEV and sequenced by deep sequencing of the small RNAs,\r\nconfirming that the virus associated with CVE is a luteovirus (Vives\r\net al., 2013). Control of the disease involves using propagation material that\r\nis free of CVEV and to protect budwood source trees from aphids to keep\r\nthe budwood source trees from becoming infected via aphids.\r\n2.7. Citrus blight disease\r\nCitrus blight is a disease of unknown etiology, but the disease is reproducibly\r\ngraft transmitted using inoculum that comes from the rootstock (Tucker, Lee,\r\nTimmer, Albrigo, & Brlansky, 1984). Different rootstocks vary in susceptibil\u0002ity to citrus blight as indicated by the age where blight symptoms become evi\u0002dent (Derrick & Timmer, 2000). Rough lemon, Rangpur lime, P. trifoliata,\r\nand Carrizo citrange are especially susceptible, whereas Cleopatra mandarin,\r\nsour orange, and sweet orange are more tolerant. Once trees develop the dis\u0002ease, the decline is irreversible, and the trees become unproductive. Early\r\nsymptoms of citrus blight are zinc deficiency symptoms in the leaves, zinc\r\naccumulation in the phloem, and eventually high zinc levels occur in the\r\nxylem. Blockage of xylem tissues with amorphous plugs occurs, resulting\r\nin reduced water uptake (Lee, Marais, Timmer, & Graham, 1984). The can\u0002opy of affected trees thins and upper shoots develop small leaves, pointing\r\nupright, the foliage has a dull green color. Overall tree decline continues with\r\ntwig dieback and root loss. Other physiological changes follow such as off sea\u0002son flowering and production of water sprouts inside the canopy (Tucker\r\net al., 1984). The first incidence of blight occurs at random in a citrus grove,\r\nbut the subsequent incidences of blight tend to be within one to two trees of\r\ntrees which are already symptomatic, suggesting a natural means of spread that\r\nis yet unknown (Castle & Gottwald, 2005). A serological assay has been devel\u0002oped to test for citrus blight (Derrick et al., 1990). Management of citrus blight\r\nincludes use of blight tolerant rootstocks and testing of budwood source trees\r\nControl of Virus Diseases of Citrus 149\r\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n"

Citrus viroids\r\nCitrus viroids are a group of small, low molecular weight (371\u2013330 nt), cir\u0002cular, infectious RNA molecules which cause various symptoms in citrus\r\nand citrus relatives (Table 1) (Brlansky & Timmer, 2014; Duran-Vila,\r\nRoistacher, Rivera-Bustamante, & Semancik, 1988). Viroids are not\r\nencapsidated in a protein. The discovery that Etrog citron was a good indi\u0002cator plant for viroids (Calavan, Frolich, Carpenter, Roistacher, &\r\nChristiansen, 1964) and the development of the sequential polyacrylamide\r\ngel electrophoresis (sPAGE) for diagnosis of the different viroids (Flores,\r\nDuran-Vila, Pallas, & Semancik, 1985) has led to the discovery of additional\r\nviroid pathogens present in citrus (Ito et al., 2001, 2007). Viroids are easily\r\ntransmitted mechanically, and care must be made to sterilize clippers, saws,\r\nand other tools used to cut or prune trees to prevent spread (Roistacher,\r\n1991). There are no reported vectors. Quarantine, clean stock, and certifi\u0002cation programs are effective in control of viroids.\r\nCitrus exocortis viroid (CEVd) was the first citrus viroid described\r\n(Roistacher, 1991). CEVd is associated with bark shelling on trees grown\r\non P. trifoliata or P. trifoliata hybrids (citranges and citrumelos), and can cause\r\ndwarfing of trees grafted on these rootstocks. CEVd is the largest citrus\r\nviroid at 371 nt, and produces the most pronounced symptoms of leaf epi\u0002nasty, stunting, and necrosis of the leaf midvein. CEVd is a species of the\r\ngenus Pospiviroid.\r\nCachexia, previously also called xyloporosis and synonymous with Hop\r\nstunt viroid, (Childs, 1950), was first demonstrated to be viroid-like in\r\n1980 when Roistacher, Nauer, and Wagner (1980) demonstrated the ability\r\nto mechanically transmit the disease and found that thermotherapy would not\r\neliminate the pathogen. The viroid was first characterized by Semancik,\r\nRoistacher, Rivera-Bustamante, and Duran-Vila (1988). Cachexia causes\r\ndwarfing and poor growth of tangelo, mandarin and Citrus macrophylla as\r\nscions or as rootstocks. On susceptible trees, cachexia causes depressions in\r\nthe wood of the tree with corresponding pegs in the bark. Cachexia\r\n(299 nt) is a species in the Hostuviroid genus.\r\nCitrus bark cracking viroid, synonymous with Citrus viroid IV, causes leaf\r\ndrooping on Etrog citron indicator plants, and general necrosis of the leaf\r\nmidribs.

Con\u0002trol of CiTLV is by use of quarantine, clean stock, and certification programs.\r\n2.10. Citrus leaf blotch\r\nCitrus leaf blotch (CLBV) was first reported from Nagami kumquat on Troyer\r\ncitrange rootstock plants that had a bud union crease (Vives, Galipienso,\r\nNavarro, Moreno, & Guerri, 2002). The CLBV is a member of the family\r\nFlexiviridae. The virus has filamentous virions about 960\u000114 nm in size with\r\na single-stranded, positive-sense genomic RNA of 8747 nt. CLBV is seed\r\ntransmitted and there are no known vectors. A similar if not identical virus\r\nwas intercepted in California while indexing a Cleopatra mandarin variety\r\nintroduced from Florida in 1968 and called Dweet mottle virus (DMV)\r\n(Krueger, Bash, & Lee, 2005). Sequencing of DMV has confirmed a 96%\r\nhomology with CLBV, but the reported host range differs slightly (Hajeri,\r\nRamadugu, Keremane, Vidalakis, & Lee, 2010). CLBV has been associated\r\nwith bud union crease with P. trifoliata or trifoliate hybrid rootstocks with Pera\r\nsweet orange in Brazil, Marsh grapefruit and Roble sweet orange in Florida,\r\nand Nules Clementine plants in Italy, and Nules, Clementine, Navelina, and\r\nNavelate sweet orange in Spain (Vives et al., 2002).\r\n2.11.

Sour orange\r\nseedlings in a cool (20\u201327 \u0003C) greenhouse are good indicator plants for mea\u0002sles disease.\r\n2.12. Yellow vein\r\nYellow vein is a graft transmissible disease reported from California in the\r\n1950s by Weathers (1960). The disease is characterized by yellow veins in\r\nthe leaves. The fruit also may develop irregular yellow blotches in the rind\r\nand are smaller and flatter than normal fruit. Many varieties and types of cit\u0002rus show symptoms of yellow vein when graft inoculated, but many of these\r\nplants recovery and do not show yellow veins on the leaves of new flushes.\r\nLimes and lemons appear to be the most symptomatic.

Citrus leprosis\r\nCitrus leprosis is one of the most important citrus viral diseases and has spread\r\nnorthward from South America to Central America and Mexico in recent\r\nyears. The leprosis disease is vectored by the Brevipalpus species mites\r\n(commonly called flat mites) in a persistent manner (Rodrigues, Kitajima,\r\nChilers, & Chagas, 2003). Once thought to be cause by a Rhabdovirus,\r\nresearch has revealed that while there are no difference in symptomology,\r\nthere are two types of citrus leprosis viruses: cytoplasmic and nuclear\r\n(Guerra-Moreno, Manjunath, Brlanksy, & Lee, 2005). The cytoplasmic\u0002type leprosis (CiLV-C) is limited to the cytoplasm.

Symp\u0002toms produced by CiLV-C and CiLV-C2 are similar.\r\nThe genome sequence of the nuclear-type leprosis virus (CiLV-N)\r\nobtained from Mexico was recently reported (Roy et al., 2013). RNA1 had\r\n6268 nts and RNA2 had 5847 nts. The genome organization closely resembles\r\nthat reported for Orchid fleck virus with 90\u201391% homology with OFV at the\r\nnucleotide level and 93\u201398% homology with amino acid sequence identities.\r\nQuarantine, clean stock, and certification programs are a key to prevent\r\nleprosis from becoming established in new areas and slowing spread within a\r\ncitrus area. Mite control slows the spread of the disease once it is established\r\nin an area. For isolated trees in a grove which become infected with leprosis,\r\nprobably because the tree did not receive the miticide application, severe\r\npruning to eliminate all symptoms of leprosis, followed by miticide applica\u0002tions are successful in recovering the trees.\r\n2.14. Citrus yellow mosaic\r\nCitrus yellow mosaic (CYMV) (synonym Citrus mosaic badnavirus) is an impor\u0002tant disease in India where infection rates are as high as 70% (Ahlawat et al.,\r\n1996). The disease infects most citrus cultivars and relatives, oranges, grape\u0002fruit, and mandarins usually show strong symptoms, while Mexican lime is\r\nsymptomless. The mature leaves show bright yellow mottling for vein\r\nflecking, fruit production is reduced and on chronically infected trees, symp\u0002toms are present on the fruit. The disease is spread by the citrus mealy bug,\r\nPlanococcus citri (Huang & Hartung, 2001). Spread by the mealy bug vector\r\nappears to be limited, widespread spread is by the use of infected propagating\r\nsource materials.\r\nCYMV is a badnavirus with nonenveloped bacilliform particles\r\n150\u000130 nm in size having a DNA genome of 7559 bp in length and six\r\nputative open reading frames, all on the plus-strand of the genome\r\n(Huang & Hartung, 2001).

Trees infected with Satsuma dwarf virus (SDV)\r\nhave spoon shaped leaves, enations, multiple flushing, stunting or dwarfing,\r\nfewer leaves, and small fruit having a thick peel (Tanaka, 1972). There are\r\nvariants of SDV, with one variant being called Citrus mosaic virus (not to be\r\nconfused with CYMV virus which is a badnavirus) (Ahlawat, Chenulu,\r\nViswanath, Pandey, & Bhagabati, 1985; Dakshinamurti & Reddy, 1975).\r\nThe SDV virion is an isometric virus particle about 26 nm in diameter.\r\nTwo RNAs are present, RNA1 with about 7000 nt and RNA2 with about\r\n5400 nt (Karasev, Han, & Iwanami, 2001). SDV has been reported from\r\nJapan, China, Iran, Korea, and Turkey, while the citrus mosaic variant of\r\nSDV has been reported only from Japan.\r\nSDV is readily transmitted by grafting, and soil transmission has been\r\nreported but not confirmed (Koizumi, Kano, Ieki, & Mae, 1988).

Huanglongbing\r\nHuanglongbing (HLB), also known as citrus greening disease, is perhaps the\r\nmost important citrus disease in areas where the disease and its vector are\r\nboth present (Bove\u00b4, 2006). The symptoms of include an asymmetrical mot\u0002tling of the leaves; frequently the midribs of the leaves are yellowed. Sectors\r\nof the canopy decline and dieback, followed by the decline and dieback of\r\nthe entire canopy. Once the tree is nearly totally infected, the tree will pro\u0002duce yellow shoots. The yellow shoots are characteristic of HLB, and HLB\r\nin Chinese translates to \u201cyellow shoot.\u201d Symptomatic fruit are lobsided, usu\u0002ally contain aborted seed, and have an off flavor. Fruit production is reduced,\r\nsymptomatic fruit is small, and fruit often drops prematurely. Over 2\u20133 years\r\nthe tree declines and dies.\r\nThree forms of HLB have been identified: the Asiatic form which is asso\u0002ciated with Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (Las); the African form which is\r\nassociated with Candidatus L. africanus (Laf ); and the American form which\r\nis associated with Candidatus L. americanus (Lam) (Jagoueix, Bove\u00b4, &\r\nGarnier, 1994; Teixeira et al., 2005).

In Brazil where Lam was first reported, the Las has out com\u0002peted Lam and Lam is rarely encountered now under field conditions (Lopes\r\net al., 2009).The host range of HLB is limited to citrus and citrus relatives.\r\nThere are two psyllid vectors of HLB: Diaphorina citri and Trioza erytreae\r\n(Bove\u00b4, 2006). Both species of the vector can transmit either the Asiatic form\r\nor the African form of HLB, and D. citri has been shown to transmit the\r\nAmerican form in Brazil (Bove\u00b4, 2006; Lopes et al., 2010). T. erytreae occurs\r\nmostly in Africa, while the D. citri occurs in northern Africa, Asia, and the\r\nAmericas. D. citri is the more efficient vector (Bove\u00b4, 2006).\r\nControl of HLB requires quarantine, clean stock, and certification pro\u0002grams in order to produce healthy plants and prevent movement of infected\r\nnursery stock. The psyllid vectors must be controlled. Florida and Texas\r\nhave begun using area-wide sprays to reduce the psyllid population during\r\nthe winter months when the psyllids are not as active and only the over\u0002wintering adults are present (Bassanezi et al., 2013). In areas where HLB\r\nis not already established, a three pronged approach to control is effective:\r\nregular surveys to identify early symptoms on trees which are then removed;\r\ncontrol of the psyllid vector by survey and pesticide application; and use of\r\nclean plant material for replanting (Bove\u00b4, 2006). Detection of the bacterium\r\nassociated with HLB is by PCR or real-time PCR. Testing psyllids for the\r\npresence of the bacterium associated with HLB by real-time PCR has\r\nproven to provide an earlier warning of the presence of the disease in an area\r\nwhere HLB is not already established (Manjunath, Halbert, Ramadugu,\r\nWebb, & Lee, 2008).\r\n3.2.

The S. citri genome has\r\nbeen sequenced (Ye et al., 1992). Stubborn causes stunting, hence the name\r\nstubborn as the infected plants do not grow. This is especially apparent in\r\nwhen young trees become infected (Roistacher, 1991). Fruit on affected\r\ntrees are often lopsided, small in size, and have aborted seed. Color inversion\r\nis often seen with the stylar end remaining green and the peduncular end\r\nshowing color. The symptoms on the tree canopy are often localized into\r\nsectors, especially when larger trees become infected. Leaves are small,\r\n156 Richard F. Lee\r\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n"

Neoaliturus haematocepts) in the Mediterranean region\r\n(Calavan & Bove\u00b4, 1989). The Spiroplasma multiplies in the vector but there\r\nis no evidence of transovarial passage. Most spread of stubborn in citrus is\r\nprimary spread: there is little evidence of citrus to citrus transmission\r\n(Yokomi et al., 2010). The leafhopper vectors have a wide host range\r\nand citrus is a temporary host if more preferred hosts are not available.\r\nStubborn has not been reported in tropical or subtropical regions.\r\nControl is by the use of quarantine, clean stock, and certification programs\r\nto ensure that healthy plants are planted in the field.

METHODS OF CONTROL OF GRAFT-TRANSMISSIBLE\r\nPATHOGENS OF CITRUS\r\nControl of citrus viruses begins though three programs: (1) quarantine\r\n(safe introduction of germplasm into an area or region), (2) clean stock pro\u0002gram (to test, therapy if necessary, and produce/provide sources of\r\npathogen-tested propagating stock for an industry), and (3) certification\r\nto ensure the maintenance and use of pathogen-tested propagating material\r\nfor commercial use (Lee, 2000; Lee, Lehman, & Navarro, 1999; Navarro,\r\n1993). These three programs will be discussed in greater detail, Figs. 1\r\nand 2 illustrate the relationship among these three programs.\r\n4.1. Quarantine programs\r\nQuarantine programs allow for the safe introduction of germplasm into an\r\narea or region. In a viable citrus industry, there is a constant demand for new\r\nvarieties for possible commercial production or for use in citrus breeding\r\nprograms. A quarantine program provides a mechanism for introduction\r\nof new varieties or cultivars into a citrus area without introducing citrus\r\nviruses or other graft-transmissible pathogens. Quarantine programs require\r\nregulatory authority and are operated under the guidance of the Ministry of\r\nAgriculture or the state Department of Agriculture.\r\nDesired germplasm is requested using an import permit so that everyone\r\nconcerned knows the material is being imported, and once the material\r\n158 Richard F.

When the buds emerge, shoot tips are cut and\r\ngrafted as in the normal shoot tip grafting protocol. Depending on the skill\r\nof the technician performing the shoot tip grafting procedure, it is most\r\nlikely the resultant recovered plant will be free of pathogens.\r\nAn alternative method of therapy, referred to a cryotherapy, is where\r\nvegetative buds are excised, treated in a buffer to remove excess water within\r\nthe cells, frozen in liquid nitrogen, then recovered under controlled condi\u0002tions and grafted onto an etiolated rootstock as done with shoot tip grafting\r\n(Wang et al., 2009). The protocol we are using for citrus is very similar to\r\nthat used for cryopreservation of citrus (Volk, Bonnart, Krueger, & Lee,\r\n2012), except that the freezing step is limited to 1\u20132 h. The advantage of\r\nthis procedure is that vegetative buds are used, not the more tender emerg\u0002ing buds as in shoot tip grafting. The buds are 1\u20131.5 mm when cut. After the\r\nfreezing step, about 0.5 of the base of the bud is excised and the resultant tip\r\nis grafted to the etiolated rootstock.\r\nRegardless of the method used to therapy the germplasm received in\r\nquarantine, it is important that the therapied germplasm be indexed for all\r\nknown graft-transmissible pathogens before being released from quarantine.\r\nThis usually requires both biological and laboratory testing. Table 2 summa\u0002rizes the pathogens tested and the test used for each pathogen as required in\r\nCalifornia. If the germplasm has been obtained from a region where a virus or\r\nvirus-like pathogen is present, that pathogen should be tested for. For exam\u0002ple, germplasm originating from Florida should be tested for citrus blight.\r\n4.2. Clean Stock Programs\r\nClean stock programs provide for recovery of healthy sources of local cul\u0002tivars and provide a mechanism whereby pathogen-tested propagating\r\nmaterial is available to the local citrus industry. A clean stock program is\r\noften carried on by a research institution utilizing the expertise of specialists\r\nin plant pathology, horticulture, and possibly other departments, but the\r\nclean stock program may be operated by the regulatory agency having juris\u0002diction over the citrus production area.\r\nThere are several steps in a clean stock program (see generalized scheme\r\nin Fig. 1). The clean stock program selects mother trees from local cultivars,\r\nthe selection of potential mother trees should be made with regard to hor\u0002ticultural characteristics without pathogen content being considered. How\u0002ever, it is usually recommended that a measurable trait or phenotype be used\r\nto make the best use of limited resources.

The trees\r\nare indexed to determine what citrus viruses are present. Therapy follows,\r\neither shoot tip grafting or thermotherapy, depending on viruses present and\r\nexpertise and facilities available. Following therapy, the resultant recovered\r\npotential mother trees must be completely indexed for all graft-transmissible\r\npathogens present in the area.\r\nAn important component of a clean stock program is the horticultural\r\nevaluation. The availability of the data from the horticultural evaluation is\r\nvaluable to the local industry in helping growers decide if they want to grow\r\na particular cultivar or variety. In Florida, the productivity on a per tree basis\r\nover a 15\u201320 year period was increased by 10\u201315% because the growers\r\ncould evaluate the publically available data obtained from the horticultural\r\nevaluation trials from the accessions being therapied in the Florida clean\r\nstock program (Lee, 2000). The clean stock program maintains a source\r\nof mother trees, usually under protected conditions to prevent possible\r\ninsect vectors access, and makes budwood available upon request.\r\n4.3. Certification Programs\r\nCertification programs are important to guarantee the sanitary status and\r\nhorticultural quality of propagating material for the commercial production\r\nof nursery plants (Lee, 2000; Lee et al., 1999; Navarro, 1993). Certification\r\nprograms must have regulatory authority and are usually operated by a state\r\nor provincial agency having the legal authority to impose restrictions. All the\r\npropagation of citrus is done by commercial nurseries, but the primary foun\u0002dation trees are usually maintained by the agency in charge of the certifica\u0002tion program. In a certification program, testing of primary foundation trees\r\non a recurring basis is done for commonly occurring citrus viruses or viroids\r\nand nursery increase blocks may be tested for pathogens known to be insect\r\nvectored in the region. A typical scheme for a certification program is shown\r\nin Fig. 2.\r\n5. OTHER METHODS OF CONTROL\r\n5.1.

        "html": "in California pest management areas for the suppression of CTV were\r\nestablished in the Central Valley of California in 1963 (Gottwald et al.,\r\n2002). An epidemic of CTV decline on sour orange had occurred in the\r\nsouthern California production area resulting a wide spread incidence of tris\u0002teza, but CTV was rarely found in the Central Valley production area\r\n(Fresno, Kern, Madera, and Tulare counties). To control losses due to\r\nCTV, the Central California Citrus Pest Control Agency was charged with\r\nlocating and removing CTV-infected trees. This agency was later renamed\r\nthe Central California Tristeza Eradication Agency (CCTEA) with respon\u0002sibility through an agreement of the Joint Operations of the Tristeza Erad\u0002ication Program (Joint Powers Agreement or JPA) of what was then five\r\ncitrus pest control districts in Fresno, Tulare, and Kern counties. Two of\r\nthe districts withdrew in 1995 and 1996, leaving three pest management dis\u0002tricts. The program is funded by a special assessment on growers depending\r\non the acreage of citrus in the district.\r\nThe purpose of the CCTEA is to identify and eradicate CTV in a timely,\r\norderly, and cost effective manner and to encourage and support appropriate\r\nresearch programs that pursue method to eliminate the threat of CTV\r\n(Gottwald et al., 2002). The program has been charged with ensuring that\r\nall trees planted in the suppressive areas remain virus-free by identifying res\u0002ervoirs of CTV so the trees can be eliminated. While the approach for sur\u0002veying and eliminating CTV has changed over the years and technology has\r\nbeen developed and applied, the area still has a very low incidence of CTV\r\nafter five decades.\r\n5.2. Mild strain cross-protection\r\nMSCP is the phenomenon which occurs when a mild isolate of a virus is\r\ninoculated into a plant, and when that plant is later inoculated (or chal\u0002lenged) with a severe isolate of the same virus, the symptoms of the severe\r\nisolate are suppressed or delayed in expression (Lee, Brlansky, Garnsey, &\r\nYokomi, 1987). MSCP is not the same as virus resistance. MSCP as a man\u0002agement strategy is useful only when (1) the disease is endemic with no other\r\npossibility of control; (2) there is confidence that the mild isolate being used\r\nwill not spread and cause damage in other crops or act in combination with\r\nother viruses to cause more severe damage; (3) there is some level of con\u0002fidence that the mild isolate being used is stable (especially if it has been\r\nderived by mutation) and will continue to be mild when purposefully inoc\u0002ulated into many plants.\r\nControl of Virus Diseases of Citrus 165\r\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n"

Empirically selected mild\r\nisolates of CTV have been used in several citrus production areas to maintain\r\nthe ability to produce fruit despite the presence of severe stem pitting strains\r\nof CTV; Pera sweet orange in Brazil (Muller & Costa, 1987 \u20ac ), grapefruit in\r\nAustralia and South Africa, limes in India, Hassuku dwarf on pummelo in\r\nJapan. More recently, in Florida isolates of CTV were empirically selected\r\nwhich protected against CTV decline on sour orange rootstock (Lee &\r\nKeremane, 2013).\r\nThe mechanism of MSCP in citrus is not understood, and it is probable\r\nthat several mechanisms are involved in the phenomena perhaps depending\r\non the virus and/or host. The mechanisms of protein mediated protection,\r\nsuch as CP-mediated resistance, RNA-mediated resistance, and RNA\r\nsilencing have been suggested as mechanisms of cross protection. The prac\u0002tical cross protection employed at the field level so far has involved selection\r\nof cross protection strains by empirical methods, but as a better understand\u0002ing of the mechanisms(s) determine the efficiency and effectiveness of\r\nMSCP, better and quicker methods of selection of isolates for MSCP should\r\ndevelop in the foreseeable future.

This protection by RNA hybrid\u0002ization theory has been demonstrated at the cell level but not at the whole\r\nplant level.\r\nVirus resistance due to an expressed transgene with sequence homology\r\nto the virus is a form of RNA-mediated resistance (Febres, Lee, & Moore,\r\n2008; Lindbo, Silvarosales, Proebsting, & Dougherty, 1993; Ratcliff,\r\nHarrison, & Baulcombe, 1997; Waterhouse, Graham, & Wang, 1998). This\r\nRNA-mediated resistance, also called gene silencing, and has been termed\r\nRNA interference or RNAi. Silencing is initiated in plants by dsRNA that is\r\nprocessed into small interfering RNA (siRNA) of about 21\u201326 nt. The\r\nsiRNAs then mediate RNA degradation of complementary sequences; a\r\nprocess known as posttransciptional gene silencing (PTGS). SiRNAs can\r\nalso direct methylation of complementary DNA sequences (Mette,\r\nAufsatz, van der Winden, Matzke, & Matzke, 2000; Wassenegger,\r\nHeimes, Riedel, & Sanger, 1994). Thus, methylation of the transcribed\r\nsequence is associated with PTGS. Methylation of promoter sequences\r\ninhibits transcription. RNAi has been proposed to be a natural plant defense\r\nmechanism against viruses and transposons and is also involved in the\r\nregulation of the expression levels of certain gene (Voinnet, 2002;\r\nWaterhouse, Wang, & Lough, 2001).\r\nRNA-mediated protection against CTV has been reported in Duncan\r\ngrapefruit transformed with the 30 end of the CTV genome (Febres et al.,\r\n2008). The most resistant line showed no transgene mRNA accumulation\r\nand promoter methylation of cytosines; both characteristic of PTGS.\r\nMost likely MSCP uses one of these two methods as suggested by exper\u0002iments with transformed plants, either CP-mediated resistance or RNA\u0002mediated resistance, or a combination. The virus and even strain of the virus\r\nprobably determines the mechanism used. Regardless, at least with CTV,\r\nmild strain cross-protection, using empirically selected strains, has been\r\ndemonstrated to be a viable control mechanism. Further research will pro\u0002vide more information as to the nature of this protection.\r\nREFERENCES\r\nAguilar, E., Villalobos, W., Moreira, L., Rodriguez, C. M., Kitajima, E.
