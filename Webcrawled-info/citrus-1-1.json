After that in 1983-84 a development scheme, “Intensification of Research on Fodder” was approved by the Govt. of Punjab and a post of Guar Botanist was sanctioned at Bahawalpur. In 1986-87, this development scheme was converted into Non-development project and a full-fledged Agricultural Research Station started work under the control of the Director, Fodder Research Institute, Sargodha. This station mainly deals with guar [Cyamopsis tetragonoloba L. (Taub)] crop. Guar is a drought tolerant, summer annual legume, well adapted to arid and semi-arid regions of Pakistan. Although, guar is considered to be a minor crop, it has a larger role among the domesticated plants that supply the food and needs of human beings as it contains a high content of nutritional quality protein. Guar is the only commercially exploited source of a very valuable product called “Galactomannan” (guar gum, 25-35%) derived from its endosperm.\n\nGuar gum has diversified industrial applications e.g. food, pharmaceutical, textile industry, drugs, paper, cosmetics, tobacco, oil & gas well drilling, hydraulic fracking, fish farming, poultry and cattle feed, paint, leather, firefighting, explosive, beverages, confectionary, dairy products, baby pampers, mosquito mats, photography, mining, construction and so on. It is also used for vegetable, green manuring, guar meal and fodder purposes. On account of industrial value, guar has great demand from foreign countries like USA, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, UAE, Lesotho, South Africa, Hong Kong, China, Japan, Australia, etc. Pakistan exports guar and guar products to more than 60 countries of the world. Guar gum is an important source for foreign exchange earnings. World’s most of the guar is grown in tropical deserts of Indo-Pak Sub Content. India produces 75% of guar, Pakistan 20% and only 5% is produced by the other countries (USA, S. Africa, Sudan and Australia). Keeping in view the importance of its seed, this station is conducting research to develop high yielding, early maturing, drought tolerant and disease and insect resistant varieties of guar with high gum contents.\n\nThis station also conducts Adaptability fodder yield trials of Lucerne, Berseem, Oats, Sorghum, Maize and Pearl Millets and produces BNS and pre-basic seed of these crops.\n\nMission\n\nStriving for better nutrition for live stock\n\nObjectives\nDevelopment of new high yielding (seed, fodder & vegetable) short duration and early maturing varieties of guar resistant to Insect pests and diseases.\nProduction of Pre-basic seed of Lucerne, Berseem, oats, sorghum and guar. \nAdaptability Trials of fodder crops like Lucerne, Berseem, Oats, Sorghum, Maize and Pearl Millet.\nTransfer of the production technology of fodder crops to the farmers. \nResearch Activities\nAcquisition, maintenance and evaluation of guar germplasm for use in breeding programme.\nHybridization and study of filial generations of guar.\nIdentification of promising progeny lines of guar\nAdaptability and yield evaluation trials of guar\nScreening of advance lines of guar against insect pest and diseases.\nEvaluation of advance lines of guar under drought stress conditions to address climate change.\nAgronomic studies of advance lines of guar for optimization of seed rate, sowing method, sowing time, row spacing, irrigational requirements and other inputs like NPK. \nProduction of Pre-basic seed of Lucerne, Berseem, oats, sorghum and guar. \nAdaptability/Zonal/ National Uniform Fodder Yield Trials of fodder crops like Lucerne, Berseem, Oats, Sorghum, Maize and Pearl Millet.\nTransfer of the production technology of fodder crops to the farmers. \n\nTeam Members: Mr. Rashid Minhas (Senior Scientist), Mr. Muhammad Shahjhan Bukhari (Scientific Officer), Mr. Muhammad Zubair (Scientific Officer), Mr. Muhammad Imran Akram (Scientific Officer) and Mr. Rahmat Ullah (Scientific Officer), \n\n​\n\nServices\nDemonstration of fodder production technology to the farmers.\nProvision of pre-basic seed of fodder crops like guar, Lucerne, Berseem, oats and sorghum to the farmers and seed companies of the southern Punjab.\nProvision of guar germplasm for research purposes to different research institutes and universities on their request.\nAdvisory services to the visiting farmers regarding varietal selection, control of insect pest and diseases, harvesting and storage of crop seed etc.\nContact Us\nPrincipal Scientist\nE-mail: grsbwp@gmail.com\nMobile: +92-62-9330011\nAddress: Agricultural Research Station, Gulberg Road, Modal, Town-A, Bahawalpur, Pakistan\n\n \n\nFeedback|Contact Us|Site Map|Khaad Hisab APP\nFBUtubePhone\nAll Rights Reserved © Ayub Agricultural Research Institute (AARI), Faisalabad\nPowered by: Punjab Information Technology Board"

The Station has developed many virus tolerant and high yield strains, out of which the Punjab Seed council has approved FVH-53 during 1998 and VH-259 (Bt) during 2013. As a result of breeding work, heat tolerant strains VH-142, VH-144 and VH-148 have shown 70-80% boll retention and covered 11% of total area of cotton during 2003 to 2006. Non Bt advanced line VH-289 developed by the station has shown excellent performance against CLCuV with good fibre traits; and was much liked by the farmers and was sown on large area during 2006-2010. Since the resurgence of Burewala strain of Cotton Leaf Curl Virus (CLCuV), more than 6000 lines have been screened up till now against this disease from different research institution/centers. Consequently MNH-770 was screened out as highly CLCuV tolerant strain which is being used as base population in hybridization work at various research centers to produce CLCuV tolerant varieties. Promising Bt. strains of American cotton VH-259, VH-282 and VH-291 have been developed at the station. Out of this VH-259 has been approved for general cultivation during 2013. Research work is also under progress to develop Armyworm and Glyphosate tolerant Bt. cotton varieties. This station has developed two more varieties VH-305 and VH-327 which are high yielding and CLCuV resistant. VH-327 can perform excellent with low inputs.

Our main research focus is to develop cotton leaf curl virus resistant varieties. Desi cotton is resistant to CLCuV disease. Therefore, a project granted by PARB was started in 2009 to transfer CLCuV resistant genes from desi cotton into American cotton.\n\nPARB Project No.215.\n\nDevelopment and commercialization of Cotton Leaf Curl Virus resistant/tolerant indigenous transgenic Bt and Glyphosate resistant cotton hybrids.\n\nCotton crop faces insect problem such as bollworms in addition to weeds competition and CLCV. All these factors adversely affect the yield of the already low yielding open pollinated cotton varieties compared with hybrids. This project will address bollworm problem with Bt genes, weeds problem with Glyphosate tolerant genes and improved CLCV tolerance. Over and above this, the hybrids will be better yielder than OP varieties.\n\n \n\t\nIntroductions\n\n    Cotton is the most important cash crop of Pakistan. It is a major source of foreign exchange earnings and also provides livelihood to millions of people in Pakistan. Southern Punjab (Multan, Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan and D.G. Khan Divisions) having cotton–wheat-cotton cropping pattern is a major belt of cotton production in Punjab. Cotton Research Station Multan is the first and the oldest cotton research centre established in Southern Punjab with the main objective of developing cotton varieties particularly for this cotton belt. It is the hub of cotton research activities and up till now16 varieties of cotton have been evolved at this research station which is the highest number in Punjab. MNH-93, S-12 and MNH-886 (Bt.) have been the most popular varieties cultivated on more than 60% and about 30 % area in Punjab and Sindh provinces respectively. Total impact on economic contribution of CRS Multan verities is estimated about 600 million rupees which is the highest share by any other cotton research centre in Pakistan. At present the main focus of research study is to solve major problem of Cotton Leaf Curl Virus disease which has been causing a colossal loss of 2-3 million bales annually. Besides heat tolerance and drought tolerance are the other main areas where research work is actively going on. Currently, study on two projects funded by Punjab Agriculture Research Board “Introgression of cotton leaf curl virus resistance genes from Gossypium arboreum (desi cotton) into Gossypium hirsutum (upland cotton) and Development and commercialization of Cotton Leaf Curl Virus resistant/tolerant indigenous transgenic Bt and Glyphosate resistant cotton hybrids” is also in progress. The peculiar feature of this research station is its extensive studies on interspecific hybridization. We have maintained germplasm of 22 species and developed interspecific hybrids. We have collaboration with USDA through ICARDA for exploring CLCuV resistant sources of cotton, and Nanjing Agriculture University China where one scientist from this research station is doing Ph.D. on identification of cotton leaf curl resistance through molecular techniques. We are also imparting training to undergraduate students of different universities and colleges. At present we have a team of 21 scientists constituting four sections, i.e., Plant Breeding & Genetics, Entomology, Agronomy and Fiber Technology. 40 experiments are conducted on various aspects of cotton on 21 acres of land.\n\nObjectives\nThe main objectives of this station are as under: -\nEnrichment of cotton germplasm.\nTo develop new varieties of cotton suited to southern Punjab.\nTo explore cotton leaf curl virus immune/resistant genetic sources of cotton.\nTo evolve heat and drought tolerant varieties of cotton\nTo develop long staple varieties of cotton.\nTo develop cotton production technology for small farmers.\nTo extend advisory services to farming community for enhancing their production.\nHistory\n\nCotton Research Station Multan was established in 1935 as a testing centre and upgraded in 1958 as full fledge Cotton Research Station Multan. It is the oldest and important cotton research centre in Punjab.\n\nFuture Plan\nGermplasm enhancement through import and interspecific hybridization to broaden the genetic base of cotton.\nDevelopment of cotton varieties having bollworm, glyphosate and CLCuV resistance.\nDevelopment of ideotypes suited for mechanical picking.\nTo study the mechanism of resistance of different pests against pesticides.\nStudy of host plants of emerging pests like dusky cotton bug and red cotton bug etc.\nMolecular assisted selection for CLCuV resistance, long staple cotton, heat tolerance and drought tolerance etc. We need establishment of molecular lab for this purpose.\nQuality assessment of new cotton varieties to facilitate the breeders and to provide quality material to the industry as per the requirement.\nUtilization of cotton by-products and crop residues for value added products\nResearch and skill oriented Human Resource Development\nDevelopment of low cost production technology for small farmers.\nTarget for production consumption, seed cotton yield per hectare and exports are given as under,\n\n      Production = 25 million bales\n\n      Consumption = 22.5 million bales\n\n      Seed cotton yield = 1200 kg/ha\n\n      Exports = 30 billion us dollar\n\n \n\nFeedback|Contact Us|Site Map|Khaad Hisab APP\nFBUtubePhone\nAll Rights Reserved © Ayub Agricultural Research Institute (AARI), Faisalabad\nPowered by: Punjab Information Technology Board"

Gummosis/Bark Splitting\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include rotted roots; cracked bark, accompanied by gumming. \nWater-soaked, reddish-brown to black bark at the soil line.\nDiscolored tissue in the lower trunk. Yellowing, sparse foliage and death of the tree.  \nExcess soil moisture favors production and spread of zoospores.  \nTherefore, increased drainage and careful irrigation is an important factor in disease management. \nManagement\nResistant Rootstock \nCultural Control\n\nPlant trees on high enough so that the first lateral roots are just covered with soil. \n\nBudding of the plants at height of 9 inches  \nChemical control\n\n                 Copper   3 gm/lit. of water\n                 Fosetyl-AL 2.5 gm/ lit. of water      \n                 Metalaxyl+Mancozeb 2.5gm/lit. of water\n\n2. Citrus Scab\nSymptoms\nCitrus scab attacks the fruit, leaves and twigs, producing slightly raised, irregular scab-by or wart-like outgrowths.\nThe scabs are grey or pinkish at first and become darker with age.\nThey are more common on lemon fruits than leaves. \nThe raised lumps associated with scab can be confused with symptoms caused by the disease botrytis or with wind rub abrasions. \n3. Citrus Melanose\nSymptoms\nLeaves\nLesions begin as small, circular dark depressions with yellow margins. \nAs the disease progresses, spots become raised and turn dark brown. \nLeaves turn yellow and prematurely drop. \nFruit\nSpots initially are small, light brown, and sunken.\nAs the disease progresses, spots become dark and raised.\nSpots that are close together can coalesce to form a rough-irregular or rough surface. \nDamage is typically superficial on fruit. \nLesions can typically be found on dying twigs.\n\nIt can be severe following rainy periods in the spring and seems to be worse when preceded by a freeze.\n\nControl/Management of Scab/Melanose Diseases\nCultural practices, Sanitation – pruning – No intercropping & careful irrigation .\n3 Sprays are Recommended to control the diseases.\n1st SPRAY (Before Flowering) Copper Based Fungicides e.g. Copper Oxycholoride or Copper Hydrooxide @ 3gm/lit. of  water\n2nd SPRAY (After Petal Fall) Difenoconazl+Azoxystrobin ( Amistar or Nanok @ 1ml/lit. of water)\n3rd SPRAY (Moon Soon) Copper Based Fungicides Copper Oxycholoride or Copper Hydrooxide @ 3gm/lit. of   water\n4. Citrus Canker\nSymptoms\nYoung lesions are raised on both leaf surfaces, particularly on the lower leaf surface. \nThe pustules later become corky and crater-like, with raised margins, sunken centers and surrounded by a yellow halo. \nFruit lesions vary in size because the rind is susceptible for a longer period of time and more than one infection cycle can occur on fruit. \nTwigs and stem infections resemble those on fruit. \nThe lesions are raised with a corky appearance and can support long term survival of the bacterium. \nMajor citrus canker outbreaks generally occur when new shoots are emerging or when fruit are in the early stages of development.\nCitrus canker is mostly a cosmetic disease, but when conditions are highly favorable for infection, it causes defoliation, shoot die-back, and fruit drop.\nDisease Management\nExclusion\n\nThe first line of defense against citrus canker is exclusion.\n\nSanitation\n\nNumerous cases of new infections of citrus canker are linked to human and mechanical transmission.\n\nEradication\n\nOnce introduced into an area, elimination of inoculum by removal and destruction of infected and exposed trees is the most accepted form of eradication.\n\nChemical Control\n1st spray of Bordeauxe mixture (1%) after fruit harvest)\n2nd spray during the month of April Copper Oxycholoride @3gm/lit. of water)\n3rd spray during the month of July-August Copper Hydrooxide @2.5gm/lit. of water\n5. Citrus Greening\nSymptoms\nStylar end greening\nStylar end greening on samples of various fruit infected with HLB. The infected fruit is contrasted against non-infected normal fruit. (Note the greening at the stylarend in contrast to the normal orange color).\nLeaf mottle typical for greening disease\nleaf mottle and general chlorosis of leaves. \nSeed abortion\nClassical seed abortion from fruit of an HLB infected sweet orange tree. Note the small purple colored seeds contrasted with normal seeds. This is also typical for stubborn disease.\nManagement\nRemoval of infected trees\nVector control  ( citrus psylla) by spraying Novastar or Confidar @1ml/lit. of water\nDisease free planting material\n6. Citrus Psylla\nIntegrated Control Measures\nFollowing practices should be used to reduce the damage by citrus psylla:\nMonitor the population of citrus psylla by hanging yellow sticky cards on trees to capture adults.\nPrune the trees after the last harvest fruits.\nIn biological control lady bird beetle and Temarixia radiata should be used as bio-control agents.\nChemical control by chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, imidacloprid, and bifenthrin can reduce the population upto 70-80%.\n7. Citrus Mealybug\nIntegrated Control of Citrus Mealybug\nRemove alternate host plants.\nMealybugs are primarily managed by  destroying  their eggs by cultural practices\nNative predators include lady beetles, lacewings, and syrphid flies.\nApplication of Carbofuran early in December with irrigation water kills the emerging nymphs/crawlers.\nSpray of bifenthrin, imidacloprid, acetamiprid @ 1.25 ml/liter of water or methidathion @ 2 ml/ liter of water on the soil or on the trunk of the tree should be applied later.\n8. Citrus Whitefly\nIntegrated Management of Citrus Whitefly\nSeveral parasites and predators attack the citrus whitefly. Lacewing larva (Chrysoperla sp.) feeds on whitefly nymphs and a wasp Encarsia is useful parasitoid of citrus whitefly.\nYellow sticky traps are helpful for monitoring and suppressing adult populations.\nAlways inspect new plants for whiteflies and nymphs before introducing them in the greenhouse or garden\nWater sprays (syringing) may also be useful in dislodging adults. Watering can also reduce the hot, dry dusty conditions that favor whiteflies and inhibit their natural enemies.\nIf populations are high, use a least-toxic, short-lived organic pesticide such as acetamiprid to establish control.\n9. Citrus Thrips\nIntegrated Management of Thrips\nMonitoring citrus for citrus thrips begins at the initiation of bloom, but becomes critical at petal fall (90% blossom drop) in late-March to early April. \nA number of natural enemies attack citrus thrips including predaceous mites, spiders, lacewings, minute pirate bugs, etc.\nSpinetoram, spinosad, or abamectin are recommended to avoid severe mortality of natural enemies.\n10. Citrus Red Scale\nIntegrated Management of Scales\nTrees should be internally pruned and opened up so that the parasites can gain access to the scales.\nInsecticides such as pyriproxyfen, buprofezin, and Spirotetramat are quite safer to use.\n11. Citrus Leafminer\nIntegrated Management of Leafminer\nApplication of fertilizers in winter to promote flush growth in spring when the pest is either absent or relatively scarce.\nPruning of late summer and autumn flush growth can also be used to limit and remove unsightly infestations on home garden trees.\nThree of the most effective wasps are Ageniaspis citricola and Cirrospilus quadristriatus and Semiolacher petiolatus.\nImidacloprid, thiamethoxam and spinosad are recommended for Leafminer control.\n12. Fruit Fly Insect Control\nIntegrated Management of Fruit Flies\nFollowing integrated control measures should be adopted for the fruit flies:\nEradication of alternate and non-essential host plants.\nThe collection and destruction of fallen, damaged and overripe fruits is strongly recommended to reduce the resident population of fruit flies.\nFruit should be picked off from the trees as it ripens; this stops the flies from laying eggs inside it, and prevents any larvae surviving.\nMonitoring of fruit fly population in the citrus orchards by installing sex pheromone traps of yellow and/or transparent colors is highly recommended in the early summer to late in the season. Five traps per acre should be installed. Methyl eugenol traps are used for male fruit flies while for female traps baited with protein hydrolysate should be used. These traps are impregnated with insecticide spinosad.\n\n \n\nFeedback|Contact Us|Site Map|Khaad Hisab APP\nFBUtubePhone\nAll Rights Reserved © Ayub Agricultural Research Institute (AARI), Faisalabad\nPowered by: Punjab Information Technology Board"
