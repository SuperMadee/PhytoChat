By understanding different plant diseases, you can spot signs of infection, treat symptoms and prevent the spread. Here’s how to identify and control these conditions for healthy growth.\n\nHow Do You Identify a Plant Disease?\n\nIdentifying plant diseases requires knowing what symptoms to look for. Infections can affect a plant’s growth, function, color and appearance. When you see the warning signs, you can intervene early and treat plants effectively.\n\nIf you notice signs of disease, you can also take samples of affected areas and send them to a local university or treatment center for lab testing and diagnosis.\n\nCommon Plant Diseases\n\nYou can take preventive measures once you know how to identify various plant diseases. Here are some to look for.\n\n1. Anthracnose\n\nAnthracnose is a fungal disease that affects plants, trees, fruits and vegetables. It can cause physical symptoms like dark sunken lesions on leaves, flowers, fruits and stems. The fast-spreading fungus also affects developing shoots and leaves.\n\nFungus on plants, vegetables, fruits and trees is one of the leading causes of anthracnose. This plant disease can proliferate in warm and humid conditions and spread by watering. Anthracnose can affect whole vegetables and kill twigs on trees.\n\nCommon signs of anthracnose include:\n\nSmall yellow or brown dots on leaves\nDark spots and pink spore masses on fruits\n\nHere are some tips for treating anthracnose plant disease:\n\nRemove and dispose of affected plants.\nPrune dead wood on trees and dispose of infected leaves.\nSpray plants with a copper-based fungicide.\n2. Blossom-End Rot\n\nBlossom-end rot is a calcium deficiency in plants and crops that breaks down the blossom or bottom end of fruiting crops like tomatoes, squash and eggplant.\n\nProblems that lead to this issue include:\n\nOver- or underwatering soil\nImbalanced soil pH\nHigh sodium levels\nPlant root damage\nExcessive nitrogen-heavy fertilizer\n\nYou can identify blossom-end rot by looking for dark, sunken spots on the bottoms of green, ripening fruits or hollow black or brown bruises that spread to half the fruit.\n\nTake the following steps to treat affected areas and prevent blossom-end rot from spreading to other developing crops:\n\nTrim damaged fruit areas.\nTest your soil’s calcium.\nFrequently check your soil pH.\nStalk plants while they are developing.\nPlant calcium-tolerant vegetable cultivators.\nAdd mulch to retain moisture in dry seasons.\nAvoid overfertilizing soil and use a calcium-dense fertilizer.\nWater plants consistently and avoid underwatering and overwatering.\n\n3. Downy Mildew\n\nDowny mildew is a fungal disease that causes leaves to wither and turn yellow. It can kill leaves but does not affect the plant stems and petioles. Downy mildew can affect crops like basil, watermelon, cucumbers, sunflowers and grapes. This fungus can thrive and spread in humid and warm climates, causing severe crop reduction.\n\nSigns of downy mildew include:\n\nYellowing and molding in leaves\nGray spores on the underside of leaves\nYellow mosaic pattern on the upper leaf surface\nInfected areas turning brown\n\nTry these downy mildew treatments:\n\nRemove and dispose of infected plants.\nTrim and dispose of infected areas.\nPrune lower leaves to increase air circulation.\nSanitize shears with bleach or alcohol to prevent the spread.\nKeep plants dry.\nKeep leaves off the ground.\nWater plants with a drip-line irrigation system.\nAdd mulch to keep the soil moist.\n4. Early Blight\n\nEarly blight is a fungal disease that affects tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants and peppers. Rapidly spreading fungal pathogens cause early blight. Wet, humid and rainy conditions like morning dew create the ideal environment for early blight to proliferate.\n\nSince it’s easy to confuse early blight with septoria and bacterial leaf spot disease, it’s essential to know what symptoms to look for. Signs of early blight can include:\n\nQuarter-inch to half-inch brown spots\nOval spots on stems and damaged fruit near the stem\nDark brown rings on leaves and yellow leaf tissue around the brown spots\n\nEarly bright can be challenging to cure, and cultural methods can be the best solution.\n\nRemove and dispose of infected plant areas as early as possible.\nCultivate more tolerant plant variants.\nUse fertile soil.\nIrrigate from below and avoid overhead systems.\nAdd mulch to the soil and reduce soil splash.\n5. Mosaic Viruses\n\nMosaic viruses commonly affect crops like tomatoes, cucumbers and squash, causing yellow, white and dark green spots and streaks on the leaves. Common signs of mosaic viruses include:\n\nBlister-like yellow and white molted leaves\nStunted plant growth and leaf deformities\n\nPreventing mosaic viruses is vital, as they can be challenging to cure. You can minimize mosaic virus plant damage with these treatments:\n\nRemove and burn or throw out infected plant areas.\nSanitize gardening tools with light bleaches to minimize the spread.\nMonitor surrounding plants.\n6. Powdery Mildew\n\nPowdery mildew is a white fungal disease affecting plants like squash, melons, tomatoes, roses and legumes. Powdery mildew can form on top of infected leaves. The white mildew spores spread to other plants in the wind. Powdery mildew can stunt plant growth and reduce fruit yield and quality. It thrives in warm, dry and humid climates and primarily affects plants in shady areas.\n\nSigns of powdery mildew can include:\n\nDusty white leaves\nWhite circular spots\nMildew on the upper part of leaves\nDisfigured leaves and buds\n\nIf your plants become infected, your best option is to prevent the spread. You can use fungicides to help prevent mildew growth.\n\nTreat powdery mildew by:\n\nRemoving and safely disposing of infected plant areas like stems and fruit\nNever composting infected plants\n7. Rust Plant Disease\n\nRust disease is a fungus that thrives in mild, moist climates, affecting plant health, strength and flower production. Rust disease spores can spread by wind or water and infect other plants.\n\nRust plant disease may resemble metal corrosion. Warning signs can include:\n\nYellow or white upper leaf spots.\nRed or orange blisters underneath leaves.\nSpores forming in spots and leaf distortion.\n\nRust plant disease treatment\n\nRemove and destroy infected plant areas\nAvoid splashing water plants to prevent the spread\nClean dirt in between plants.\n8. White Mold\n\nWhite mold is a fungal disease affecting numerous plant types like lettuce, beans and peas. White mold fungus can develop in spring and summer and spread to other plants by the wind in cool conditions. Signs of white mold can include:\n\nWhite-soaked stems\nWilting stems with tan or dark lesions\n\nHow to treat white mold:\n\nRemove affected plants.\nUse mulch or plastic to cover the infected ground and prevent spread.\nReplace infected soil with clean soil.\n\nControl Plant Disease With CropCare® Equipment\n\nKnowing how to treat plant diseases is vital for protecting your plant and crop quality.
