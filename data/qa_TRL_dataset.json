    {
        "prompt": "What is the effect of repeated application of the same pesticide on pests?",
        "chosen": "Repeated application of the same pesticide may induce development of resistant types of the pest, making it less effective in the long run.",
        "rejected": "Repeated application of the same pesticide is a reliable way to control pests, and it will always be effective."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What is the role of natural enemies in biological control?",
        "chosen": "Natural enemies play a crucial role in biological control by attacking and controlling pest populations, reducing the need for chemical pesticides.",
        "rejected": "Natural enemies are not effective in controlling pest populations, and chemical pesticides are necessary to ensure crop protection."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What is the impact of pests on citrus crops?",
        "chosen": "Pests can cause significant damage to citrus crops, including stunting of trees, chlorosis, leaf and fruit drop, reduction in fruit size, and decline of tree growth.",
        "rejected": "Pests have a minimal impact on citrus crops, and their effects can be easily controlled with chemical pesticides."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Are ants a significant pest in citrus crops?",
        "chosen": "Yes, ants can cause serious damage to foliage and attack natural protecting enemies, making them a significant pest in citrus crops.",
        "rejected": "No, ants are not a significant pest in citrus crops, and their impact is minimal and easily manageable."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What are some common vertebrate pests of citrus trees?",
        "chosen": "Vertebrate citrus pests include rabbits, squirrels, rats, gophers, wild pigs, deer, and birds. (positive because it lists specific examples of pests)",
        "rejected": "Vertebrate citrus pests include a variety of unwanted animals that can damage citrus trees, but it's hard to identify them all. (negative because it's general and doesn't provide specific examples)"
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What methods are used to control vertebrate pests of citrus trees?",
        "chosen": "Control methods for vertebrate pests of citrus trees include baits, traps, shooting, fumigation, and habitat modification. (positive because it lists specific control methods)",
        "rejected": "The methods used to control vertebrate pests of citrus trees vary and are often ineffective, requiring constant monitoring and adjustments. (negative because it implies that control methods are ineffective)"
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Are some vertebrate pests protected animals?",
        "chosen": "Yes, some vertebrate pests of citrus trees are protected animals, and their elimination is permitted only when the damage they cause is economically important. (positive because it provides specific information)",
        "rejected": "The protected status of vertebrate pests of citrus trees makes it difficult to control them effectively, as harming them can be illegal. (negative because it implies difficulty in controlling pests)"
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What is the purpose of habitat modification in controlling vertebrate pests of citrus trees?",
        "chosen": "Habitat modification is a control method that aims to alter the environment to make it less conducive to the presence of vertebrate pests, reducing their impact on citrus trees. (positive because it explains the purpose of habitat modification)",
        "rejected": "Habitat modification is often expensive and time-consuming, and its effectiveness in controlling vertebrate pests of citrus trees is uncertain. (negative because it highlights the challenges and uncertainties)"
