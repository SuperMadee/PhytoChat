**Watering and Plant Disease**

Q1: How does water contribute to plant diseases?
A1: Water, especially water droplets on leaves and stems, plays a major part in plant diseases.

Q2: What types of plant diseases are caused by fungi and bacteria?
A2: Most plant diseases in the state are caused by fungi, but bacterial diseases also occur.

Q3: How do fungal spores and bacterial cells spread?
A3: They spread by seed-like structures called spores or by cells, often carried on the wind, in raindrops, or in irrigation water.

Q4: What is the ideal condition for fungal spores to germinate?
A4: Fungal spores require a film of free moisture for at least 9 hours to germinate and penetrate the plant leaf.

Q5: How can you reduce the spread of plant diseases?
A5: Reduce the number of free moisture periods and the length of those periods by watering only when needed and watering deeply.

Q6: Why is it important to water plants deeply?
A6: Watering deeply allows the plant roots to penetrate as deeply into the soil as possible, avoiding drying cycles of the upper soil layers.

Q7: How can you check the depth of soil moisture?
A7: Use an unpainted wooden dowel to check if the soil moisture has penetrated to about 4 inches.

Q8: What is the best way to water plants?
A8: Water plants at the base of the plants or use drip irrigation and soaker hoses to reduce the amount of free moisture on plant canopies.
