The majority of bacterial pathogens need no insect vector at all, for example, \r\nthe xanthomonads causing citrus canker, although disease incidence can be dramatically accelerated by leafminers. These \r\nxanthomonads enter through stomata or wounds, actively attacking mesophyll cells from the outside and directly affecting \r\ncitrus cell gene expression by injection of eukaryotic transcription factors. Nevertheless, as discussed in detail below, there \r\nis remarkably little variation in resistance among commercially grown citrus genera, species, and varieties to the Asiatic \r\nstrains of the disease.\r\nLiberibacters are literally injected by their psyllid vectors directly into living phloem cells. Psyllids free of Liberibacters \r\nmay be introduced into a citrus growing region free of Huanglongbing (HLB), resulting only in the direct damage caused \r\nby the psyllid. Independent of vector introduction, Liberibacters may be introduced by planting infected and asymptomatic \r\ncitrus into a previously uninfected region, but the pathogen cannot spread without an insect vector with host range on citrus. \r\nAs discussed in some detail below, the excessively long incubation period required before HLB symptoms become recog\u0002nizable can prevent or frustrate timely detection of such introductions, even with inspections. Epidemics can result from \r\nthe intersection of these two independent introduction events, as appears to have occurred relatively recently in Florida with \r\nHLB. Of course, both events can be concurrent. Again, however, there is remarkably little variation in resistance among \r\ncommercially grown citrus varieties to Liberibacter infections.\r\nIt is useful to distinguish between parasitism and pathogenicity. A parasite is capable of deriving nutrition from, and \r\nreproducing on or within, its host(s), and is not always associated with the disease. For example, a Liberibacter-infected \r\npear tree is nearly asymptomatic (Raddadi et\u00a0al., 2011). A pathogen causes disease, but not always on all hosts. Pathologists \r\ntypically pay attention only to pathogens on commercially important crops, but pathogens can have a much wider parasitic \r\nhost range than expected if they cause no disease or cause the disease on weeds. A recurring theme in this chapter involves \r\nthe worldwide increase in commerce and in transcontinental dispersal of many pathogens and their vectors. The fact that \r\nthere is often overlap of parasitic, if not pathogenic, host ranges of multiple bacterial species, and the fact that apparent host \r\nrange limitations of a given pathogen can be disguised by the host range limitations of its insect vector can result in emerg\u0002ing and sometimes surprisingly severe disease threats. In general terms, if a vector is introduced into a geographic region \r\nwith an unusually wide host range that may include weed or arboreal crops, it is conceivable that the vector may facilitate \r\nexposure of previously isolated bacterial populations to one another, thereby facilitating horizontal gene transfer events, \r\neither by cell\u2013cell conjugation or by phage transduction within either the insect vector or plant host. Transcontinental dis\u0002persal of pathogens and vectors dramatically increases the opportunities for horizontal gene transfer and allows increased \r\nrecombination frequencies between pathogenic variants of a species and even across genera.\r\nChapter 18"

In the case of citrus variegated \r\nchlorosis (CVC), despite the fact that sharpshooters feeding on both oranges and other citrus varieties are abundantly avail\u0002able, it is therefore perhaps surprising that host range on citrus appears limited to Citrus sinensis. Why only sweet orange? \r\nOne can speculate that since coffee plantations with coffee leaf scorch disease are in close proximity to citrus groves with \r\nCVC in Brazil and since both diseases are caused by the same X. fastidiosa subspecies pauca (Xfp), the opportunity arose \r\nfor horizontal gene transfer or recombination of host range factors that allowed emergence of CVC. Recombination is docu\u0002mented between Xf subsp. morus strains pathogenic to mulberry and blueberry in the United States (Almeida and Nunney, \r\n2015), and Xfp strains from coffee (Jacques et\u00a0al., 2016). The wide variation in Xylella pathogenicity and host range il\u0002lustrates the need for a better understanding of the genetic factors determining both. In contrast with both citrus canker and \r\nHLB, there is remarkably strong variation in resistance among commercially grown citrus genera.\r\nIn all the three cases, each involving very different pathogen disease cycle and reproductive strategies, the causal \r\nbacterial genera exhibited a wide host range, pathogenicity, and genome variations that indicate horizontal gene transfer \r\nof pathogenicity factors. Selection in citrus monocultures does the rest. In addition to the three bacterial pathogens most \r\ndamaging to commercial citrus that are the focus of this chapter, other bacteria causing notable citrus diseases of worldwide \r\nimportance include Burkholderia andropogonis (bacterial brown leaf spot) and a few Mollicute (lacking a cell wall) species \r\nsuch as Spiroplasma citri (citrus stubborn disease) and Phytoplasma species (witches\u2019 broom disease of lime and HLB-like \r\ndiseases). Currently the worldwide incidence and importance of these bacteria are minor.\r\n18.2 Citrus canker\r\n18.2.1 History and background\r\nAsiatic citrus canker (ACC) is an important bacterial disease of citrus with severe yield, trade, and quarantine implications. \r\nThe ACC is also referred to as \u201cCanker A\u201d and is by far the most widespread and severe form of the disease. The disease is \r\ncaused by Xanthomonas citri (ex Hasse 1915) (Gabriel et\u00a0al., 1989) subsp. citri (Schaad et\u00a0al., 2006) pathotype A (XccA). \r\nHistorical synonyms for XccA are X. citri, Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri, and Xanthomonas campestris pv. citri\r\n\u201cstrain\u201d A). ACC is believed to have originated in Southeast Asia-India based on herbarium specimens from India and Java \r\nin the 1830\u20131840s. During the 1900s it was found throughout Asia, including Japan, as well as South and Central Africa, \r\nMiddle East, Australia, New Zealand, Pacific Islands, South America and Florida, USA. Another form of citrus canker, \r\n\u201cCancrosis B,\u201d with nearly identical symptoms as ACC (erumpent, hyperplastic lesions on leaves, stems, and fruit are the \r\nkey diagnostic symptoms) emerged in South America (Carrera, 1933) with host range limited to lemons, Mexican lime, \r\nsour orange, and pummelo (Stall and Seymour, 1983). Cancrosis B is also referred to as \u201cFalse canker\u201d or \u201cCanker B\u201d and \r\nis caused by a different and phylogenetically quite distinct species, Xanthomonas fuscans subsp. aurantifolii (Xfa) (Schaad \r\net\u00a0al., 2006) pathotype B (XfaB). Cancrosis B is prevalent on lemons in Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, but is less ag\u0002gressive than ACC and is largely under control (Canteros et\u00a0al., 2017). Since it is in a separate species, XfaB (Cancrosis \r\nB) strains can be easily differentiated by microbiological, serological, genetic, and host range inoculation tests from XccA \r\n(ACC) strains.\r\nWhat do the two species, X. citri and X. fuscans, have in common to allow their respective subspecies, Xcc and Xfa, \r\nto elicit very similar symptoms on citrus? Both encode and inject nearly identical eukaryotic transcriptional activator-like \r\n(TAL) protein effectors into citrus cells. Pathogenicity gene pthA was the first member of the avrBs3/pthA gene family dem\u0002onstrated to function for pathogenicity and is required for both growth and pathogenicity of XccA strains on citrus (Swarup \r\net\u00a0al., 1991, 1992). pthA is capable of conferring ability to cause canker-like symptoms to strains that cannot otherwise \r\ncause canker, such as X. aurantifolii pv. citrumelo. A very close homolog, pthB, is similarly required for pathogenicity of \r\nXfaB (Cancrosis B) strain B69 and is found on a self-mobilizing plasmid that can transfer itself between these two species \r\n(El-Yacoubi et\u00a0al., 2007). All canker-causing strains of X. citri subsp. citri tested carry pthA homologs (Cubero and Graham, \r\n2002; Mavrodieva et\u00a0 al., 2004; Munoz-Bodnar et\u00a0 al., 2017). When pthA is transiently expressed in citrus using either \r\nAgrobacterium tumefaciens or particle bombardment, small canker-like lesions are elicited (Duan et\u00a0al., 1999). Therefore, \r\npthA and its homologs encode the primary causal effectors of the citrus canker disease phenotype.\r\nNot surprisingly, variant pathotypes within both Xcc and Xfa species have emerged that are primarily distinguished \r\non the basis of host range and determined by apparently minor differences in virulence factors. A third citrus canker type, \r\ndescribed as Cancrosis C or \u201cCanker C,\u201d was discovered in Brazil on Mexican lime by Namekata (1971) with an even more \r\nrestricted host range than XfaB (Cancrosis B) strains (Stall and Seymour, 1983). Cancrosis C is also caused by Xfa, and \r\nstrains of this group (XfaC) are primarily limited to Mexican lime, although sour orange can also be a host. XfaC strains are \r\ncurrently distinguished from XfaB strains by pathogenicity tests and from ACC strains by species-level tests."

        "html": "Bacterial pathogens of citrus: Citrus canker, citrus variegated chlorosis and Huanglongbing Chapter | 18 373\r\nVariants of X. citri subsp. citri (Xcc) have also emerged more recently. These also elicit ACC-like lesions but with less \r\naggressive symptoms and with host range largely limited to Mexican lime: XccA* and XccAw (Gordon et\u00a0al., 2015). XccA* \r\nstrains were discovered in Oman, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and India with host range limited to Mexican lime (Verni\u00e8re et\u00a0al., \r\n1998). The XccAW pathotype is also characterized by host range restricted to Mexican lime and lemon and has to date only \r\nbeen found in Florida and Texas (Munoz-Bodnar et\u00a0al., 2017). Grapefruit (Citrus paradisi), resistant to both XccA* and \r\nXccAW strains, may serve to differentiate the two groups, since XccAW strains elicit a strong hypersensitive response (HR) \r\nin grapefruit, while XccA* strains do not (Brunings and Gabriel, 2003). A single avirulence gene was found to restrict an \r\nXccAw strain from virulence on grapefruit, but this gene was not detected in XccA* strains tested (Rybak et\u00a0al., 2009). \r\nInterestingly, XfaC strains also cause an HR on grapefruit, while XfaB strains do not (Brunings and Gabriel, 2003). Minor \r\ngenetic differences in one or a few virulence factors may account for the differences from XccA in the restriction of these \r\npathotypes to lime and from each other. The restricted host range variants of Xcc (XccA* and XccAW) and Xfa (XfaB and \r\nXfaC) are of limited worldwide distribution and economic consequence and therefore further discussion will be limited to \r\nACC, caused by XccA.\r\n18.2.2 Symptoms and epidemiology of ACC\r\nACC is primarily a leaf and fruit spotting disease characterized by erumpent lesions (cankers) on fruit, foliage, and young \r\nstems (Fig.\u00a018.1) of susceptible cultivars of citrus (Schubert et\u00a0al., 2001; Timmer et\u00a0al., 1996). Most commercial citrus \r\nvarieties are moderately to highly susceptible to the disease, although grapefruit is the most susceptible fruit. When the \r\ndisease is severe, defoliation, dieback, and fruit drop can occur and infected fruit that remain are less valuable or entirely \r\nunmarketable (Graham and Gottwald, 1991). ACC is spread by rain splash combined with wind and is greatly exacerbated \r\nby tropical storms and hurricanes (Gottwald et\u00a0al., 2002). ACC epidemics are aggravated by the Asian citrus leaf miner, \r\nPhyllocnistis citrella, introduced to Florida in 1993 and to Brazil in 1996. Where the leaf miner and citrus canker coincide, \r\ncanker has increased significantly as a consequence of the insect\u2019s feeding activities which create wounds that expose leaf \r\nmesophyll tissues to splashed inoculum, thus greatly expanding the probability of infection (Gottwald et\u00a0al., 1997, 2007).\r\nDuring seasons when spring and summer rains are combined with wind speeds in excess of 8m/s damage from the dis\u0002ease can range from nominal to significant (Serizawa et\u00a0al., 1969; Serizawa and Inoue, 1974). When lesions on leaves are \r\nwetted for only 1\u20132min, the bacteria ooze to the surface in great numbers and this inoculum release can persist for several \r\nhours, continuously providing inoculum for dispersal throughout prolonged storm events (Bock et\u00a0al., 2010a,b). Distance of \r\nspread due to bacterial aerosols is directly related to rain splash and wind speed, from a few cm during gentle rains without \r\nwind to several km during tropical storms and hurricanes (Gottwald and Irey, 2007; Bock et\u00a0al., 2011). For moderate wind\u0002blown rain events, natural windbreaks such as conifers or hardwood trees with interlocking canopies can effectively reduce \r\nwind speed and trap windblown inoculum, thereby reducing infection. Citriculturists effectively control ACC in Argentina \r\nFIG.\u00a018.1 Asiatic citrus canker (ACC) lesions on leaves, fruit, and young stems of grapefruit."

Spread is often human mediated by contaminated clothing, vehicles, equipment (e.g., pruners, \r\nhedgers, mowers, ladders, harvesters), or animals either in commercial or residential citrus. When the foliage is wetted, the \r\nbacteria ooze from the hyperplastic lesions that have broken the foliar surfaces (for a physiological process description, \r\nrefer Brunings and Gabriel, 2003) and can be transferred when the mechanical device, human, or animal come in contact \r\nwith the bacterial ooze and inadvertently transfer it to susceptible foliar tissues on adjacent or distant trees.\r\n18.2.3 ACC control through eradication\r\nACC currently exists in the majority of commercial citrus producing regions of the world and in the Americas has plagued \r\nmultiple States in the Southeastern US, as well as Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay (Braithwaite \r\net\u00a0al., 2002; Koizumi, 1985; Gottwald et\u00a0al., 2007). The approach to controlling ACC depends on whether the disease is \r\nnewly introduced or if it has become endemic. If it is newly introduced, by far the best approach is eradication. ACC in\u0002festations have most significant impact on commerce and trade due to the governmental regulatory actions that result in \r\nrestricted interstate and international transport and sale of fruit originating from known infested areas.\r\nThe consequences of ACC introduction to citriculture must be examined through a historical, economic, and sociopo\u0002litical lens to fully comprehend its impact. If the disease is recently introduced and in low incidence, eradication has often \r\nbeen attempted to return the area to a disease-free status, thereby avoiding the cost of quarantines and unfavorable trade \r\nimpediments. Conceptually, eradication is quite simple. Diseased plants must be removed more rapidly than they become \r\ndiseased. The more rapidly and efficiently diseased individuals are removed, the less chance of continued pathogen spread, \r\nand the quicker the disease will be extinguished. In practice, however, eradication is complex. It is not always easy to recog\u0002nize newly infected plants. A several week-long incubation period between infection and disease expression is quite com\u0002mon. Thus, some infected members of the plant population are \u201csubclinical\u201d; that is, infected but not yet expressing disease. \r\nFor ACC the subclinical infections can persist for 10\u201314days without expressing symptoms and even then, these symptoms \r\nare not always easily seen. The average time of detection in residential areas was estimated to be 108days postinfection \r\nproviding ample time for polycyclic reproduction and spread (Gottwald et\u00a0al., 2001a,b).\r\nAdditionally, diseased plants are not always recognizably aggregated into convenient or contained groups for easy \r\neradication. The disease is often somewhat considerably diffuse among an otherwise healthy population. The combination \r\nof lengthy incubation periods and diffuse patterns of disease necessitates that to achieve eradication, large radii around rec\u0002ognized infections of both diseased and asymptomatic but potentially latently infected plants must be removed or \u201cculled\u201d \r\nas well (Gottwald et\u00a0al., 2001a,b, 2002, 2007; Schubert et\u00a0al., 2001). For ACC epidemics, the resulting eradication programs \r\nhave at times exceeded the social tolerance of commercial growers and additionally residential homeowners who resist \r\nthe removal of their apparently healthy but potentially asymptomatically affected trees in support of the commercial citrus \r\nindustry.\r\nSeveral early eradication programs were successful in South Africa, Australia, the Fiji Islands, Mozambique, New \r\nZealand, and the United States (Koizumi, 1985). In Northeast Argentina, ACC was first recognized in 1928 and eradication \r\nwas attempted in 1976 but subsequently failed in part due to grower\u2019s concern and reluctance to remove the large propor\u0002tions of commercial trees to achieve eradication (Canteros et\u00a0al., 2017; Hogg, 1985; Rodriguez, 2012). In Australia ACC \r\nhas been introduced and successfully eradicated three times: 1918, 1984 and a third time in Queensland in 2004 (Gambley \r\net\u00a0al., 2009). In Brazil ACC was first detected in 1957 and eradication programs were intermittent over the next 60years \r\neventually leading to establishment of ACC; by 2009 the disease was declared endemic and the eradication program halted \r\n(Behlau et\u00a0al., 2016).\r\nACC was first detected in Florida in 1910 and it was eradicated by the 1930s after massive removal of infected trees \r\n(Schubert et\u00a0al., 2001). ACC was discovered a second time in Florida in 1986 and was declared eradicated in 1992 but was \r\ndiscovered a third time in multiple residential areas in Dade County in 1995 within a 14 mile2 area south of the Miami \r\nInternational Airport (Gottwald et\u00a0al., 2001a,b). This discovery prompted an intensive eradication campaign by a joint state/\r\nfederal citrus canker eradication program (CCEP). The program was based on an epidemiological study of ACC spread that \r\nresulted in an ACC-eradication protocol that required the removal of all \u201cexposed trees\u201d within a 579-m radius of a known \r\ninfected tree (Gottwald et\u00a0al., 2001a,b). Over the next 10years, the canker eradication program cost approximately $1 bil\u0002lion dollars, the largest plant disease eradication program worldwide to date. The program was plagued by legal conflicts \r\nbetween the CCEP and residential homeowners who felt that the regulatory actions being taken protected the citrus industry \r\nat too high a cost to residential citrus tree owners. The litigation of numerous injunctions and appeals led to a discontinu\u0002ous and sporadic eradication program. As the legalities of eradication were debated, the disease continued to spread, and \r\noutbreaks in new commercial and residential areas erupted across Florida."

In 2004, three hurricanes and a major tropical storm crossed the \r\nFlorida peninsula and exacerbated preexisting ACC infections and caused overwhelming dispersal of the pathogen over the \r\ncommercial industry. Statistical models developed to predict the spread of ACC due to hurricanes and tropical storms led \r\nto numerous discoveries of new ACC outbreaks and more effective and rapid eradication (Irey et\u00a0al., 2006). However, hur\u0002ricane Wilma struck Florida in the Fall of 2005 and caused such massive additional spread of the disease that the regulatory \r\nagencies, citrus industry, and research scientists alike concluded that the disease had likely become ineradicable, resulting \r\nin the termination of the 10-year, $1 billion canker eradication program (Gottwald and Irey, 2007). As a consequence, ACC \r\nhas greatly increased and is now found throughout the majority of Florida\u2019s commercial groves.\r\n18.2.4 Endemic control/mitigation of ACC\r\nWhere ACC is endemic, mitigation requires integration of appropriate cultural practices including windbreaks and \r\nleafminer control, with frequent applications of copper (copper hydroxide and copper oxychloride) sprays (Leite Jr et\u00a0al., \r\n1987). Leafminer control via insecticides is particularly important for young trees and certain cultivars that have more \r\nfrequent and longer duration of growth flush. Copper sprays reduce infection somewhat. Fruit are most susceptible for \r\n90 days after petal fall when copper is most efficacious. Grapefruit is highly susceptible to ACC requiring more sprays \r\nto provide acceptable control compared to orange or mandarins which are much less susceptible. Antibiotics such as \r\ngentamicin, kasugamycin, and streptomycin also have activity for canker control if properly formulated. However, the \r\npossibility of eliciting bacterial resistance and human and animal health issues raise concerns about wide scale antibiotic \r\nuse in agriculture (Graham et\u00a0al., 2006; Behlau et\u00a0al., 2012). Recently the control of ACC via the use of nano-formulated \r\nzinc oxide was shown to exceed the cuprous oxide and cuprous oxide/zinc oxide bactericides, although deployment has \r\nnot been wide scale (Graham et\u00a0al., 2016).\r\n18.2.5 Implications of citrus canker quarantines and trade\r\nThe risk of introduction of citrus canker bacteria to new, unaffected citrus producing areas is a major concern for those \r\ncitrus industries attempting to remain free of citrus canker. If canker is introduced, quarantines and restrictions could en\u0002sue that would severely limit or deny access to domestic and international markets. Various regulatory agencies such as \r\nUSDA (United States Department of Agriculture), APHIS (Animal and Plant Health inspection Service) initiate extensive \r\nPest Risk Assessments and Risk Management Analysis to evaluate the potential for processed fruit as a pathway for ACC \r\nintroduction. Based on the assessments and analyses, regulatory agencies develop regulations under which fruit may be \r\nmoved interstate or intercountry from quarantined areas. To address fruit as a pathway, a series of studies were conducted \r\nwith citrus fruit as a potential pathway for XccA to enter and become established in these areas, including: (1) survival of \r\nXccA in disease lesions on fruit and on fruit surface after disinfectant treatment as used by commercial packing houses; (2) \r\nsurvival of XccA in culled fruit that were discarded in cull piles, and (3) dissemination of XccA and disease establishment \r\nin simulated rainstorms. Taken as a group, this series of studies on canker bacteria viability in and on fruit surfaces, and \r\nbacteria dissemination, demonstrated that harvested and packinghouse-disinfested citrus fruit are extremely unlikely to be a \r\npathway for canker to reach and become established in canker-free areas (Gottwald et\u00a0al., 2009). These studies have helped \r\nto diminish the need of quarantines and maintain open markets and trade.\r\n18.3 Citrus variegated chlorosis\r\n18.3.1 History and background\r\nXylella fastidiosa (Xf) is a Gram-negative, xylem-limited, insect vectored and often difficult to culture bacterium that \r\ncauses some of the most serious plant diseases worldwide and in a wide variety of hosts. Its five (to date) described sub\u0002species tend to have strong host range preferences that may overlap, although individual strains appear to have a highly \r\nrestricted host range. Xf appears to have originated in the Americas, and causes production-limiting diseases including: (1) \r\nXf subsp. fastidiosa (Xff), which causes Pierce\u2019s disease (PD) of grapevines in the United States; (2) Xf subsp. pauca (Xfp), \r\ncauses CVC in sweet orange and coffee leaf scorch in Brazil (Nunney et\u00a0al., 2014); (3) Xf subsp. sandyi (Xfs) causes leaf \r\nscorch of oleander; (4) Xf subsp. morus causes leaf scorch of mulberry and blueberry in the United States, and (5) Xf subsp. \r\nmultiplex (Xfm) causes leaf scorch diseases in North America on a wide range of tree species, including almond, peach, oak \r\nand more recently associated with quick decline of olive trees in Italy (Almeida and Nunney, 2015)."

        "html": "376 The genus citrus\r\nCVC is transmitted by sharpshooters and has so far been found limited in host range only to sweet orange varieties. \r\nThe first trees affected by the disease were observed in 1984 in Argentina, where it was named \u201cpecosita\u201d or \u201cfalsa man\u0002cha grasienta\u201d (Contreras, 1992), and in 1987 in Brazil within the main citrus growing belt of the country in the northern \r\nregion of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo (Rossetti et\u00a0al., 1990). Currently, CVC is present in all major Brazilian citrus producing \r\nareas. Nevertheless, in the last 30 years of known disease outbreaks in Brazil, despite the wide distribution on many citrus \r\nvarieties and occurrence of large populations of the species of sharpshooters known to transmit the pathogen (Yamamoto \r\nand Gravena, 2000), no other citrus type was found affected by the disease. This indicates that the host range limitation to \r\nsweet orange is determined by the Xfp genome.\r\nXylem colonization of Xfp starts when the insect vector carrying the pathogen feeds on the xylem sap of a healthy \r\ntree. Xylem colonization is enhanced by enzymes that degrade the xylem pit membranes, which would otherwise occlude \r\nmovement of objects as large as Xf (Roper et\u00a0al., 2006). Xfp colonization ultimately leads to the obstruction of sap flow \r\n(Queir\u00f3z-Voltan and Paradela, 1999; Garcia et\u00a0al., 2012), with infected trees expressing symptoms characteristic of the dis\u0002ease first on leaves and later on fruits. Symptoms may be elicited by multiple pathogenicity factors that may not correlate \r\nwith ability to colonize the xylem (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2015). CVC-affected leaves show small spots distributed throughout on \r\nboth the surfaces (Fig.\u00a018.2). As the infection progresses, orange gum appears in the center of the spot present on the lower \r\nsurface of the leaf. In later infection stages, the yellow spots coalesce and become necrotic. Highly affected leaves usually \r\nabscise, leaving behind tufts of small leaves at the tips of affected branches, which commonly exhibit symptoms resembling \r\nzinc deficiency. The fruits that appear on the affected branches usually do not drop, as happens in the case of trees affected \r\nby HLB. Instead they mature earlier and are smaller (Fig.\u00a018.2) and much harder. The fruit are also richer in sugar but more \r\nacidic than the fruit from asymptomatic branches of infected or healthy trees (Laranjeira and Palazzo, 1999). The smaller \r\nsize causes direct losses since larger numbers of affected fruits are needed to fill a typical commercial box of 40.8 kg (Ayres, \r\n2000). The harder fruits can slow commercial juice production, while the smaller size also makes the fruits less acceptable \r\nto consumers in fresh markets.\r\nThe disease progress of CVC is faster in younger than older trees, and in trees exposed to seasonal water deficits, as \r\nhappens more frequently in the northern regions of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. Under these conditions, tree development is \r\nhighly affected by the disease, with the decrease in fruit production reaching up to 75% of that in healthy or asymptomatic \r\ntrees (Ayres, 2000).\r\n18.3.2 Disease management, control, and mitigation\r\nIn Brazil, CVC management has relied on the use of preventive measures, particularly eradication of symptomatic citrus, to \r\nreduce inoculum sources and the chances of recurrent infections. Although weeds and some arboreal plants may harbor Xfp, \r\nthe apparently low bacterium titer and short life of weedy hosts greatly limit their importance as sources of CVC (Lopes \r\nFIG.\u00a018.2 Mature leaves and fruits of sweet orange severely affected by citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC). Note the raised, gummy pustules on the \r\nabaxial leaf surface in (A). The two green fruits at the top right of (B) are unaffected."

Correct identification of diseased trees is an important step in this process which, due to constant appearance of \r\nnew symptomatic trees as a result of constant infections, requires frequent and careful tree inspections. Under certain condi\u0002tions, the health of diseased trees may be restored by drastic pruning of symptomatic branches. However, for pruning to be \r\nsuccessful the tree must be over 2.5years of age and the symptoms present at the tip of only one secondary branch (Rodas, \r\n1994). Recently, based on the high levels of resistance to Xfp infection observed for the Cravo Rangpur lime rootstock \r\n(Garcia et\u00a0al., 2012), a new mitigation measure was developed (Lopes, 2019). Since the bacteria do not move downwards be\u0002low the graft union into these rootstocks, new healthy scions can be generated by removing all the infected scion, even from \r\nhighly affected sweet orange trees, and grafting with healthy budwood onto these rootstocks. Unfortunately, the immunity to \r\nCVC exhibited by the rootstocks does not transfer to the scion. However, the new shoots that develop on the rootstock trunk \r\nproduced new fruits faster and at lower costs than those on the new regularly planted nursery trees.\r\nSince the removal of infected trees is not uniformly followed by all growers, the inoculum pressure from neighboring \r\ngroves may be high in some areas. Therefore, and as for HLB, aggressive control of the insect vector is a critical component \r\nof CVC control. Currently, such control consists in treating younger trees to be used for replants with systemic insecticides \r\napplied to the trunk (Yamamoto, 2008). In the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, young trees for planting are produced inside screened \r\nnurseries, where they are protected from infected sharpshooters. Clean nursery tree production is a key aspect of CVC \r\ncontrol, and has been mandatory in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo since 2003. Systemic insecticide treatments of nursery stock \r\nprior to field planting will protect the trees for the next 2\u20133months. New applications of systemic and regular spray of \r\ncontact insecticides must be carried out for the following 2\u00a0years after field planting (Yamamoto, 2008), a period when the \r\ntrees constantly flush with new shoots and become attractive to the vectors. After this period, the effectiveness of systemic \r\ninsecticide applications is reduced, and the trees must be protected with contact insecticide only, which should be applied \r\nmore frequently during flushing.\r\n18.3.3 Recent discoveries and advances\r\nIn the last three decades, new research and field observations have revealed important aspects of the CVC pathosystem \r\nwhich have contributed to improved cultural practices and strategies to control CVC. The Xfp CVC strain 9a5c was the \r\nfirst plant pathogen to have its genome completely sequenced (Simpson et\u00a0al., 2000). Functional genomic analyses allowed \r\nthe development of testable hypotheses that revealed many new aspects of the mechanisms of Xf pathogenicity and bacte\u0002rial adaptation to the xylem sap. It also revealed important and previously unknown vulnerabilities of these pathogens. For \r\nexample, while most bacterial pathogens carry multiple redundant copies of TolC, a critical bacterial efflux pump compo\u0002nent is needed to efflux toxic phytoanticipins, phytoalexins, and/or antibiotics; Xf strains carry only one copy of TolC and \r\ninactivation of this gene is lethal for growth in xylem sap (Reddy et\u00a0al., 2007). The biology, migration patterns, feeding \r\nbehavior, and pathogen transmission by the insect vector were also elucidated. New experimental procedures allowed for \r\nmore precise evaluation of the responses of the distinct citrus varieties and species to pathogen infection (Lopes et\u00a0al., \r\n2005), and the impact of the environment on disease progress and severity was determined.\r\nDuring this period of intensive research activity and implementation of integrated pest management strategies, CVC \r\nincidence initially continued increasing, reaching 34%\u201344% of the average 200 million orange trees grown in state of S\u00e3o \r\nPaulo from 1999 to 2012. However, the incidence dropped from 37.6% in 2012 to 6.8% in 2015. A further decrease was \r\nobserved in the 2016 and 2017 surveys, and currently <3.0% of the trees express CVC symptoms in the main citrus belt of \r\nBrazil (http://www.fundecitrus.com.br/comunicacao/revistas). The losses attributed to the disease, estimated in the range \r\nof $100\u2013120 million per year in the period of high incidence (Bov\u00e9 and Ayres, 2007; Lopes et\u00a0al., 2004), were in 2017 \r\nnegligible. Several technical advances help explain the level of control achieved, but other cultural factors were equally \r\nimportant, including: (1) the removal of large areas of abandoned groves, which must have significantly contributed to \r\ndecrease sources of inoculum; (2) an aggressive inspection and eradication program, and (3) the increased rigor and wider \r\nefforts to control the insect vector. Grower attitudes toward stronger and more cooperative integrated control measures were \r\ngreatly stimulated by the report and fast spread of an even more destructive and incurable insect transmitted citrus disease, \r\nas described below.\r\n18.4 Huanglongbing\r\n18.4.1 History and background\r\nHLB, also known as \u201ccitrus greening,\u201d is caused by uncultured, phloem-restricted alpha-proteobacteria in the genus \r\nCandidatus Liberibacter.

Three species are \r\ncurrently well described as causing HLB in citrus\u2014Ca. L. asiaticus (Las), Ca. L. africanus (Laf), and Ca. L. americanus \r\n(Lam)\u2014and each species appears to have independently evolved in the continent reflecting its name (Beattie et\u00a0al., 2005; \r\nNelson et\u00a0al., 2013). HLB is currently the most significant bacterial disease of citrus worldwide. HLB is found in Asia, \r\nthe Middle East, Africa, and the Americas. It is spread by the psyllid vectors Diaphorina citri and Trioza erytreae. Other \r\nwell-described Ca. Liberibacter species with different vectors are known to cause serious diseases on solanaceous crops \r\n(Liefting et\u00a0al., 2009; Munyaneza et\u00a0al., 2009), less serious problems on celery (Teresani et\u00a0al., 2014), and almost no symp\u0002toms at all on pear (Raddadi et\u00a0al., 2011); these will not be further discussed here.\r\nReports on the occurrence of HLB as \u201cyellow shoot\u201d disease (Fig.\u00a018.3) date back to 1919 in Southwest Asia, from \r\nChina to Pakistan, 1928 in Africa, and 2004 in the American continent, although references to maladies similar to HLB \r\nare even older. HLB was first called Greening in South Africa, Mottle Leaf in the Philippines, Dieback in India, and Vein \r\nPhloem Degeneration in Indonesia; in the Americas, it is most commonly called HLB or citrus greening (Bov\u00e9, 2006; da \r\nGra\u00e7a, 1991).\r\nThe most characteristic symptom of HLB is the appearance of asymmetric, blotchy mottles on the leaves, which is a di\u0002agnostic symptom. Before the development of DNA-based diagnostic tests allowing the detection of specific Liberibacters, \r\nthe occurrence of HLB was confirmed mainly by two tests: a thin layer chromatographic test (Schwarz and van Vuuren, \r\n1970) and a starch test to demonstrate its high abundance in symptomatic samples (Su, 2008). However, both methods \r\nlacked sufficient specificity to be used routinely in diagnosis. Although transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used \r\nto identify the presence of walled bacteria in phloem cells, it is time consuming and laborious and does not distinguish \r\nbacteria at species level.\r\nIn several old descriptions of the occurrence of symptoms resembling HLB, the authors mentioned the presence of \r\npsyllids and damage caused by psyllid feeding. It was not until the 1960s that T. erytreae in South Africa (McClean and \r\nOberholzer, 1965) and D. citri in India (Capoor et\u00a0al., 1967) were demonstrated to vector the disease. In 1970 bacterial cells \r\nwere found in phloem sieve tubes (Lafl\u00e8che and Bov\u00e9, 1970), characterized as Gram-negative bacteria (Garnier et\u00a0al., 1984) \r\nand later determined to be a species of alpha proteobacteria (Jagoueix et\u00a0al., 1994). Two species were then proposed: Las \r\nfor the disease in Asia and Laf for the disease in Africa. In 2004, when HLB was seen for the first time in the Americas (in \r\nS\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil), both Las and a new species, Lam, were proposed as causal agents (Teixeira et\u00a0al., 2005b).\r\nKoch\u2019s postulates have yet to be completed for any Liberibacter, and none of the pathogenic Liberibacters have been \r\ncultured, likely because they have lost certain key genes to make them capable of axenic growth (Jain et\u00a0al., 2017b). The \r\nonly extant isolates of Liberibacter crescens (Lcr) were cultured after isolation from diseased mountain papaya in Puerto \r\nRico (Leonard et\u00a0al., 2012; Fagen et\u00a0al., 2014) but none of these could be transmitted back to papaya or any other plant or \r\ninsect host, despite numerous efforts.

Much of this conclusion rests upon diagnostic molecular tests, primarily polymerase chain \r\nreaction (PCR), which is currently the gold standard for detection and diagnosis. Metagenomics were used to sequence \r\nmultiple genomes of Las (Duan et\u00a0al., 2009; Lin et\u00a0al., 2013; Katoh et\u00a0al., 2014), Lam (Wulff et\u00a0al., 2014), and Laf (Lin \r\net\u00a0al., 2015). Molecular techniques and other tools have been used to help elucidate the insect-Liberibacter as well as the \r\nplant-Liberibacter interactions.\r\n18.4.2 Symptoms\r\nLas growth in planta is phloem limited (Fig 18.4A), causing perturbed assimilate partitioning, leaf chlorosis, loss of pro\u0002ductivity, and eventual decline and death of infected trees after several years. By contrast, the bacterium is systemic and \r\ncirculative in its psyllid host, causing only localized apoptosis in the midgut tissue and accumulating on the outside of the \r\ngut under a biofilm (Fig.\u00a018.4B) but without causing overt disease symptoms (Ghanim et\u00a0al., 2016). Field diagnoses of \r\nHLB affected trees are initially determined visually by trained human inspectors. HLB in Florida was initially discovered \r\nby spotting the appearance of \u201cyellow shoot\u201d symptoms (Fig.\u00a018.3). No field deployable device has yet been validated by \r\nPCR results as reliably allowing field use for diagnoses of Las infection of symptomatic or asymptomatic trees. However, \r\nreplicated field studies have indicated that canines can detect Las- and Laf-infected plants with >99% accuracy and prelimi\u0002nary results indicate canines will alert trained human handlers to Lam-infected plants as well (Gottwald et\u00a0al., 2017). The \r\nmain symptoms used for field diagnosis is blotchy mottle of the leaves (Fig.\u00a018.5), and also asymmetric chlorosis along the \r\naxis of the leaves, frequently delimited in color from green to yellow by veins. A similar\u2014but symmetrical\u2014yellowing of \r\nthe leaves is characteristic of zinc deficiency, and this close similarity can cause some confusion and doubt, even to trained \r\nscouts looking for symptomatic trees in areas where HLB was previously unknown.\r\nWithin one to multiple years after HLB has been identified in a citrus grove, nearly 100% of the trees typically become \r\ninfected, and often without apparent symptoms. The severity of the symptoms is correlated with the time that a plant has \r\nbeen infected. After a plant is first infected, a surprisingly lengthy (usually no shorter than 6months) incubation period is \r\nrequired before any symptoms start to develop (Lee et\u00a0al., 2015). The first symptoms are a pale or mild leaf mottle, which \r\nonly slowly progresses to more characteristic leaf mottle symptoms. Symptom progression is usually faster during the fall \r\nand winter seasons. Leaf curling, reduced leaf size, and thickening of the midveins or raised corky veins are additional \r\nsymptoms (Fig.\u00a018.6) often, but not always, found. Twig dieback is also observed but takes longer to develop. Fruits devel\u0002oping from infected branches can be lopsided (Fig.\u00a018.6), harbor aborted seeds, and have discolored columellas (Fig.\u00a018.7). \r\nFruit color inversion is sometimes seen, with yellowing starting from the peduncular end and the stylar end remaining green \r\n(these symptoms gave rise to the common name \u201cgreening\u201d). A yellow to orange abscission zone is seen in the peduncular \r\nscar of the fruits, even in the absence of color inversion (Bov\u00e9, 2006). Leaf and fruit drop are common characteristics, and \r\ninfected groves experience very high levels of premature fruit drop, exacerbated by drought conditions. Root systems are \r\nFIG.\u00a018.4 Transmission electron micrographs of (A) Ca.

Attempts to raise \r\nmonoclonal antibodies from the infected tissues failed to yield either Las-specific or universal antibodies, largely due to \r\nthe inability to grow Las in axenic cultures. However, extensive genome sequencing may now provide adequate targets for \r\nantigen production and generation of useful antibodies (Ding et\u00a0al., 2017).\r\nDNA probes for the detection of nucleic acids from Liberibacters in Southern and dot blots were developed (Villechanoux \r\net\u00a0al., 1992), but were soon surpassed by PCR-based diagnostic tests. PCR is useful for Liberibacter detection and identifi\u0002cation, both in plant and in psyllid samples (Jagoueix et\u00a0al., 1996; Hocquellet et\u00a0al., 1999; Teixeira et\u00a0al., 2005a, 2008a; Li \r\net\u00a0al., 2006; Roberts and Pietersen, 2017). There are many variations in PCR techniques and primers used, with the most \r\ncommon based on the detection of the 16S and ribosomal protein genes. Real time (semi-quantitative, or qPCR) enjoys \r\nwidespread use. PCR and qPCR are much less effective in evaluating chemical treatment effects, since DNA from dead \r\nLiberibacter cells remains in phloem cells (Trivedi et\u00a0al., 2009). In plant tissues, small pioneer or fibrous roots and seed \r\ncoats of developing seeds are the organs with highest Liberibacter cell numbers (Achor et\u00a0al., 2014). qPCR also enabled \r\nthe quantification of Las and Lam titers in plants and psyllids. Estimated average highest titers in individual psyllids were \r\n6.3\u00d7108 for Las and 5.6\u00d7104 for Lam; and in 1g of tissue of sweet orange and orange jasmine leaves, respectively, 4\u00d7107\r\nand 1\u00d7103 for Las, and 3.2\u00d7106 and 2\u00d7104 for Lam (Duan et\u00a0al., 2009; Lopes et\u00a0al., 2010; Teixeira et\u00a0al., 2008a).\r\nFluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) indicated that Las is able to colonize the filter chamber, midgut, Malpighian \r\ntubules, hemolymph, salivary glands, ovaries, and muscle and fat tissues of D. citri (Ammar et\u00a0al., 2011). Loop-mediated \r\nisothermal amplification (LAMP)-based diagnostic tests have the advantage of reduced cost of equipment, but the relative \r\nlack of specificity and single-target detection are concerns (Okuda et\u00a0al., 2005; Li et\u00a0al., 2007). Conventional PCR can be \r\nstill very useful for limited sample testing, allow multiple pathogen detection; although it is less sensitive than qPCR, but \r\nhas the advantage of reduced initial costs. For activity related to sampling and eradication programs, where laboratory di\u0002agnoses may guide scouting operations, current molecular techniques are most useful for confirmatory purposes.\r\nThe vast majority of publications dealing with diagnosis of HLB have established a consensus that Liberibacters are \r\nthe most frequently encountered causal agent of HLB.

L. europaeus was found as an asymptomatic endophyte of pear trees and Liberibacter crescens was described in 2012 \r\nas the first axenically cultivated member of this genus. Except L. crescens, all other Liberibacters\u2014that is, the known \r\npathogenic Liberibacters\u2014are all axenically uncultured to date due at least in part to the loss of the glyoxylase pathway and \r\nthe presence of phage that are repressed by host factors (Jain et\u00a0al., 2017a,b; Merfa et\u00a0al., 2019).\r\nLaf diversity at the subspecies or haplotype level in Africa is noteworthy. Besides having a host range on citrus trees, \r\nLaf subsp. capensis (LafC) has been found in cape chestnut (Calodendrum capense), while recently, additional rutaceous \r\nhosts were described for the following subspecies: Laf subsp. clauseane (LafCl) in Clausena anisata, Laf subsp. vepridis \r\n(LafV) in Vepris lanceolata, Laf subsp. zanthoxyli (LafZ) in Zanthoxylum capense, and Laf subsp. tecleae (LafZ) in Teclea \r\ngerrardii (Roberts et\u00a0al., 2015, 2017). Additionally, LafCl strains with a wide host range were identified in Citrus, with a \r\ncharacteristic pattern of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) named LafCl ex citrus. Of great importance for diagnos\u0002tic testing is the fact that the widely used 16S PCR primers used for Las identification (Li et\u00a0al., 2006) incorrectly identified \r\nLafCl ex citrus, and LafCl, LafV, and LafZ were also misidentified as Las or Laf by the same qPCR test. Clearly, additional \r\nprimer sets are required to distinguish these subspecies. A more general caution is that a great deal of care must be taken \r\nwhen dealing with first occurrences of Liberibacters in unusual places and plant and insect hosts (Roberts et\u00a0al., 2017).\r\nCurrently Las is the prevalent species in HLB samples from Brazil, China, and the United States, where Las is now \r\nfound in all citrus growing states. In Brazil, only a very limited number of samples harboring groups IX and III phytoplas\u0002mas and Lam are now found, where once Lam was the predominant HLB causal agent. One reason for the sharp decrease \r\nin Lam incidence in Brazil seems to be its lower titer levels in citrus tissues that reduce the chances of being acquired and \r\ntransmitted by psyllids (Lopes et\u00a0al., 2009a). Lam and phytoplasmas would probably show up occasionally in additional \r\nplaces. It should also be noted that since Las and Lam can be dodder transmitted to tobacco and periwinkle, it seems likely \r\nthat Ca. Liberibacter host range may be more limited by the host range of the insect vector responsible for phloem transmis\u0002sion than by any particular pathogenicity or virulence determinants in these pathogens.\r\n18.4.4 Pathogen biology: Phloem restriction in citrus, systemic infection in psyllid, and lack \r\nof axenic culture\r\nAfter the transmission of Las, Lam, and Laf to periwinkle using dodder, the bacteria were found restricted to phloem sieve \r\ntubes, as expected. The TEM was also used to characterize uncultured Ca. Liberibacters as Gram negative by visualization \r\nof the tri-lamellar cell wall envelope (Garnier et\u00a0al., 1984). Periwinkles were used for the maintenance of multiple isolates \r\nin planta at INRA in Bordeaux, France for decades by Bov\u00e9\u2019s group (Teixeira et\u00a0al., 2008a; Wulff et\u00a0al., 2014). Periwinkles \r\nhave allowed the maintenance of isolates in a smaller space than citrus and even comparative strain characterizations, \r\nsuch as heat tolerance (Las is exceptionally more heat tolerant than Lam and Laf; Bov\u00e9 et\u00a0al., 1974; Lopes et\u00a0al., 2009b), \r\nantibody generation (Garnier and Bov\u00e9, 1993; Ke et\u00a0al., 1993), and the description of the first Las phage particles (Zhang \r\net\u00a0al., 2011). Indeed, periwinkle became the source of DNA enriched for genome sequencing of Lam (Wulff et\u00a0al., 2014). \r\nHowever, transmission from periwinkle to citrus cannot be accomplished because Diaphorina citri and T. erytreae are \r\nrestricted in host range to citrus.\r\nCa. Liberibacter spp. multiply in the sieve tubes of infected plant hosts and there are pockets of sieve cells filled with \r\nelongated, electron dense young bacterial cells (Fig.\u00a018.4) while most sieve tubes are free of bacteria. Ca. Liberibacters \r\nliterally squeeze from sieve cell to sieve cell through sieve pores (Su, 2008), apparently without degrading plant cell walls, \r\nsince there are no cell wall degrading enzymes annotated in any Liberibacter genomes. With maturity, the bacterial cells \r\nform less dense spherical bodies of 600\u2013800 nm, eventually plasmolyzing (Su, 2008). As a host response to the spread of \r\nthe bacterium in the vascular system, an increase in callose deposition occurs and together with bacterial multiplication, \r\nblocks the flow of phloem sap between the cells, disrupting the source to sink movement of sugars (Koh et\u00a0al., 2012). HLB\u0002affected trees are imbalanced in sugars (Fan et\u00a0al., 2010). Notably, all pathogenic Liberibacters, by stark contrast with L. \r\ncrescens, lack any known mechanism for sucrose import, and appear to rely instead on direct import of ATP from host cells \r\n(Jain et\u00a0al., 2017b).\r\nOne consequence of the development of an intracellular lifestyle is the necessity of avoiding (to the greatest extent \r\npossible) and suppressing (where avoidance is impossible) the triggering of innate immune responses by any host, plant \r\nor insect. This can involve the shedding or downregulation of genes that directly encode such triggers; for example, fla\u0002gellin, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), or enzymes that synthesize these triggers. Flagellin and LPS are two classic examples \r\nof a general group of molecules collectively referred to as \u201cpathogen-associated molecular patterns\u201d (PAMPs), which are \r\nrecognized by the innate immune systems in eukaryotic hosts of all types (Jones and Dangl, 2006). Although flagella-like \r\nappendages have been observed on the surface of Ca. L. solanacearum infecting potato (Cicero et\u00a0al., 2016), flagella have \r\nnot been observed with any citrus-associated Liberibacter, and the flagellin produced by Las is a PAMP weaker than those "

Eukaryotic cells typically are highly sensitive to LPS, which serves as \r\na highly protective bacterial outer membrane defensive barrier against plant antimicrobial compounds such as phytoalexins; \r\ninterestingly, Lam has no LPS genes at all (Wulff et\u00a0al., 2014). The severe reduction in genome size observed generally \r\nwith all intracellular pathogenic bacteria is likely driven, in part, by selection pressure to remove genes encoding PAMPs.\r\nLas actively suppresses innate citrus immune responses to infection, helping to explain why HLB symptoms have such \r\na long incubation period following initial introduction by the psyllid vector (a period spanning multiple months to years). \r\nThe suppression of citrus defense reactions, particularly generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and prevention of \r\napoptosis, is accomplished by a phage-encoded peroxidase (Jain et\u00a0al., 2015) and two chromosomally encoded peroxire\u0002doxins (Jain et\u00a0al., 2018, 2019). The peroxidase and one peroxiredoxin are both nonclassically secreted directly into host \r\nphloem cytoplasm, resulting in: (a) straight detoxification of host-generated H2O2, (b) limited catastrophic chain reaction \r\nspread of a lipid peroxidation event in the phloem cell membrane, and (c) dampening of the systemic propagation of H2O2-\r\nmediated defense signaling in the host plant following the initial colonization event. Las peroxiredoxin may represent a \r\ncritical secreted effector conserved across all pathogenic Liberibacter species (even in the phageless strains) that functions \r\nto suppress host symptoms, a tactic used by most biotrophic plant pathogens.\r\nThe extent of Las and Lam multiplication and symptom induction in citrus is quite different. Las multiplies to 10-fold \r\nhigher titers in citrus than Lam, but Lam elicits much more severe symptoms of HLB, despite lower titer (Lopes et\u00a0al., \r\n2009a). Las can be transmitted by grafting budwood with efficiencies close to 100%, whereas Lam transmission by graft\u0002ing is usually lower than 50%. There are no comparable data for Laf. Natural transmission by psyllids is influenced by \r\nseveral factors and bacterium multiplication and temperature are key aspects. Las titer in citrus influences D. citri trans\u0002mission; while Las is readily transmitted from citrus to citrus, Lam is less efficiently transmitted. Interestingly and by \r\ncontrast, Lam titer in Murraya exotica (M. paniculata) is higher than that of Las (Lopes et\u00a0al., 2010). Murraya spp. is a \r\ngood host for Lam acquisition and transmission to sweet orange plants, but this is not true for Las (Gasparoto et\u00a0al., 2010; \r\nDamsteegt et\u00a0al., 2010).\r\n18.4.5 Genomics and taxonomy\r\nAlphaproteobacteria are quite diverse as a class, and often form associations with eukaryotes. Free-living members have ge\u0002nome sizes over 5 Mbp and include the mutualistic endosymbionts in the Rhizobiaceae family: Rhizobium, Azorhizobium, \r\nBradyrhizobium, and Mesorhizobium, as well as the pathogenic Agrobacterium species. Alphaproteobacteria are also well \r\nknown to adapt an intracellular lifestyle with differing species utilizing independent paths of severe genome reduction. \r\nThese famously include the mitochondria, as well as the Rickettsiales (including tick-borne diseases in genus Rickettsia, \r\nand endosymbionts of arthropods in genus Wolbachia). Liberibacters form a cluster of closely related alphaproteobacteria \r\nin the Rhizobiaceae family with highly reduced genomes as compared with free-living members. Interestingly, they appear \r\nmuch more highly adapted to their insect hosts than plant hosts, spreading inter- and intracellularly across salivary glands, \r\nalimentary canal, midgut epithelium and basement membrane, Malpighian tubules, hemolymph, muscle and fat tissues, and \r\novaries with little or no evidence of pathogenic effects (Ammar et\u00a0al., 2011).\r\nOnly two strains of a single species of Liberibacter, L. crescens strains BT-0 and BT-1 (NC_019907.1), have been cul\u0002tured in\u00a0vitro (Leonard et\u00a0al., 2012). Both were isolated from the sap of Babaco mountain papaya (Carica stipulata \u00d7 C. pu\u0002bescens) and are not known to be pathogenic, despite numerous efforts in several labs, and they have no known insect host. \r\nL. crescens has a slightly larger genome size (1.5Mb) than any of the pathogenic Ca. Liberibacters (all about 1.2Mb). L. \r\ncrescens appears to have diverged from the uncultured, pathogenic Ca. Liberibacter spp. early (Nakabachi et\u00a0al., 2013). The \r\nfirst Liberibacter genome to be completely sequenced was Las strain psy62 (Duan et\u00a0al., 2009); since then more than nine \r\nadditional Las genomes have been sequenced. In addition to Las, complete genome sequences were determined for Lam \r\nstrain S\u00e3o Paulo (Wulff et\u00a0al., 2014), Laf strain PTSAPSY (Lin et\u00a0al., 2015), and Lso strain CLso-ZC1 (Lin et\u00a0al., 2011). \r\nAll the chromosomes contain three ribosomal operons and genome GC% of 35.4%, while Lam GC% is lowest, at 31.1%.\r\nAll pathogenic Ca. Liberibacters contain prophage or remnants of prophage not found in L. crescens with GC% content \r\nof 36% (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2011). Typically, Las strains have 1\u20132 complete prophages, but a few strains have only remnants, such \r\nas Ishi-1 from Japan (Katoh et\u00a0al., 2014). Both prophages may be integrated in the chromosome, but one of them typically \r\nreplicates as an excision plasmid, thus expanding the copy number per cell of the encoded genes. As mentioned above, the \r\nperoxidase is encoded on the excision plasmid, can functionally suppress plant defenses and is therefore likely a horizon\u0002tally acquired lysogenic conversion factor benefitting plant infections (Jain et\u00a0al., 2015). One of the prophages can be lytic \r\nin planta and even form particles in citrus (Fu et\u00a0al., 2015), yet remain as a stable lysogen in psyllids (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2011). \r\nSuppression of Las phage gene expression appears to be critically important in psyllid hosts (Fleites et\u00a0al., 2014; Jain et\u00a0al., \r\n2017a). Despite the few horizontally acquired gene additions, comparative genomics and metabolic pathway analyses of "

        "html": "384 The genus citrus\r\nthe chromosomal genomes have revealed a trend toward reduction or complete absence of multiple biosynthetic pathways, \r\nincluding glycolysis and glyoxylase, metabolic enzymes, LPS biosynthesis, sucrose import and secretion systems in these \r\ngenomes, helping to explain the failure to obtain sustainable axenic cultures of the pathogenic Ca. Liberibacters to date \r\n(Wulff et\u00a0al., 2014; Jain et\u00a0al., 2017b).\r\n18.4.6 Epidemiology: Latency and incubation\r\nIn the absence of a vector, all Ca. Liberibacter species remain confined to their plant hosts. Citrus trees infected with vari\u0002ous pathogens are not infrequently brought into commercial citrus growing areas by unsuspecting homeowners. If a Las\u0002infected tree is brought into an area without the vector, both the tree and the Las that infects it can remain alive for many \r\nyears, due to the surprisingly long incubation period between the initial infection and the appearance of even the slightest \r\nsymptom. The vectors of HLB are also found in disease-free areas and introduction of Las-free insect vectors usually \r\nprecedes the discovery of HLB by many years. In sharp contrast to the long incubation period for HLB, the latency period \r\nof the transmission of Las from citrus to psyllid and back again is measured in weeks, and the multiplication of infected \r\npsyllid vectors is explosive (Lee et\u00a0al., 2015). The importance and surprising nature of the very short latency period for \r\ntransmission of Las, coupled with the exceptionally long incubation period for HLB cannot be overemphasized. Las epi\u0002demics spread very rapidly in completely asymptomatic trees, making early detection critical (Gottwald, 2010). T. erytreae\r\nis found in the Mediterranean basin, although the bacteria are not, so the disease is not known to be present (P\u00e9rez-Otero \r\net\u00a0al., 2015; Siverio et\u00a0al., 2017). The absence of both HLB and its vectors, such as in Australia, is a great advantage to the \r\nsuccess and sustainability of citriculture.\r\nPsyllid transmission is the only natural mode of dissemination of Las, Lam, and Laf, although spread by infected bud\u0002wood during citrus propagation may occur locally. Illicit importation of budwood or entire infected plants will spread the \r\ndisease and perhaps the vector over long distances including internationally. Strict quarantine measures should be applied \r\nto restrict the imports of propagative citrus material which originate only from certified regions or from certified plants free \r\nof psyllids and Liberibacters.\r\n18.4.7 Control/management\r\nSince there is no cure for HLB, preventive and mitigation actions must be taken, starting with quarantine regulations, imple\u0002mentation of inspections of nursery trees, and production of budwood in insect-proof nurseries. Although systemic or semi\u0002systemic antibiotics have shown promise with trunk injection (e.g., Bov\u00e9 et\u00a0al., 1980; Hu and Wang, 2016), there is some \r\ncontroversy over the widespread use of even limited types of antibiotics in agriculture. Psyllid monitoring (Miranda et\u00a0al., \r\n2017) and control (Miranda et\u00a0al., 2016) by means of insecticide control in commercial areas is a key aspect to avoid the \r\nspread of HLB-infection in orchards (Bassanezi et\u00a0al., 2013). In order to reduce inoculum, scouting for infected trees and \r\nremoval of symptomatic trees must be carried out. These three strategies have been used in South Africa, Brazil, and Costa \r\nRica (Bov\u00e9, 2012; Aubert, 1990) and proven to be effective as a regional management strategy (Bassanezi et\u00a0al., 2013). \r\nDue to the very short latency period for Las transmission, the development of presymptomatic Las detection techniques is a \r\nresearch priority. Due to the severe economic impact of HLB in regions and states where HLB infections have recently been \r\ndetected, deployment of all available early detection resources, such as the use of canines, should be strongly considered.\r\nReferences\r\nAchor, D., Davis, C.L., Brlansky, R.H., Folimonova, S.Y., 2014.
