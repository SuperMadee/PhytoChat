Not only was I mentoring my students at\r\nCornell University, but I found I was learning from them as well.\r\nI was stimulated to reflect on this by my two youngest grandchildren, Madeline\r\nTurner and Trevor Horst to whom I dedicate this 8th Edition as well as the students\r\nwho taught me while I was teaching them. Madeline initiated this process when\r\nI asked her what she was learning in kindergarten. She listed all that she was\r\nlearning. I indicated she was really getting smart and that maybe Grampy should\r\ngo to kindergarten so that he could get smart. She said \u201cNo Grampy you can\u2019t\u201d\r\nand I asked her \u201cwhy not\u201d and she said \u201cBecause you\u2019re no kid anymore\u201d.

The task has\r\nbeen a formidable one. I have always had great respect professionally\r\nfor Dr. Cynthia Westcott. That respect has grown considerably with the\r\ncompletion of the five editions. I now fully realize the tremendous amount\r\nof effort expended by Dr. Westcott in developing the Handbook. A book such\r\nas this is never finished, since one is never sure that everything has been\r\nincluded that should be. In the 4 years since the seventh edition there were\r\nmore than 600 new reports of diseases on plants. I would quote and endorse\r\nthe words of Dr. Westcott in her preface to the first edition: \u201cIt is easy enough\r\nto start a book on plant disease. It is impossible to finish it ...\u201d Dr. Cynthia\r\nWestcott passed away March 22, 1983.\r\nThis revision of the Handbook retains the same general format contained\r\nin the previous editions. The chemicals and pesticides regulations have been\r\nupdated; major taxonomic changes have been made in the bacteria, fungi,\r\nnematodes and viruses; the changing picture in diseases caused by viruses\r\nand/or virus-like agents have been described. New host plants have been\r\nadded, and many recently reported diseases as well as previously known\r\ndiseases listed now on new hosts have been included in the Handbook. In\r\naddition photographs have been retained from the seventh edition as well as\r\nthe color photograph section. For the photography work I am grateful for the\r\nhelp and expertise of Kent E. Loeffler. I also had access to the Cornell Plant\r\nPathology Herbarium, which contains a wealth of photographic work on plant\r\ndiseases that has been supplied by numerous scientists over many years.\r\nThis book should be useful to gardeners, master gardeners, botanical\r\ngardens, landscape architects, florists, nurserymen, seed and fungicide\r\ndealers, pesticide applicators, arborists, cooperative extension agents and\r\nspecialists, plant pathologists, diagnostic laboratories and consultants. The\r\nbook should also be a useful reference book for plant pathology classrooms\r\nand in some cases used as a textbook.\r\nMarch 2013 R. Kenneth Horst\r\nvii"

You will certainly not read it through from cover\r\nto cover, but I hope you will read the first and last section of \u25b6 Part I on garden\r\nchemicals. The chemicals themselves are listed in alphabetical order, by\r\ncommon names where possible, by trade names where these are used in lieu\r\nof approved common names. A few materials still in the experimental stage\r\nbut very promising are included. A few uses are suggested, but many more,\r\nwith correct dosages, will be found on the labels or in recent publications.\r\n\u25b6 Part II, on the classification of plant pathogens, can be taken or not as\r\ndesired. It provides a mycological, bacteriological, nematological and virological background for students and a review for professional workers. The\r\nbibliography gives some of the taxonomic references consulted in preparing\r\nthis very condensed treatment.\r\nThe rest of the book is in two main sections. \u25b6 Part III describes specific\r\ndiseases and gives remedies when known. The diseases are grouped\r\naccording to their common names into forty types treated in alphabetical\r\norder. \u25b6 Part IV gives over 1300 host plants in alphabetical order, from\r\nAbelia to Zoysia, according to common names except where the Latin\r\nname may mean less confusion. Under the hosts the diseases are sorted out\r\naccording to types, given in small capitals, and you can quickly thumb back to\r\nthe corresponding section, Anthracnose, Blight, Wilt, etc., in \u25b6 Part III by\r\nmeans of the running head at the top of each page.\r\nThe book works like a dictionary. In both the disease and host section the\r\nLatin name of the pathogen causing the disease is given in boldface type. The\r\nindividual diseases in the host section are listed in alphabetical order\r\naccording to the common name of the diseases.\r\nYou may be able to find the information you are seeking directly from the\r\nindex, which includes common and Latin names of hosts plants, Latin names\r\nof pathogens and common names of the diseases described in \u25b6 Part III. More\r\nthan 4000 diseases are included in that chapter and some additional pathogens\r\nare listed under Host Plants without a corresponding description of disease.\r\nWebsite addresses of state universities and agricultural experiment stations, which are sources of help for every gardener, are given following\r\n\u25b6 Part IV. The very best way to use this book is to take it in small doses as\r\nneeded. Do not let the hundreds of diseases you will never meet worry you too\r\nmuch. And remember that most plants survive, despite their troubles!\r\nxi"

It is human nature to read symptoms of an ailment and immediately assume it is your own affliction. Jumping to conclusions is as dangerous\r\nto plants as to humans. A sore throat does not necessarily mean diphtheria.\r\nOnly a trained physician can diagnose probable diphtheria, and for positive\r\nidentification a laboratory culture is necessary.\r\nA spotted or yellowed rose leaf does not necessarily mean rose black spot.\r\nMite injury, spray injury, or reaction to weather conditions may also cause\r\nspotted or yellow rose leaves; yet gardeners blithely continue increasing the\r\nspray dosage, confident that more and stronger chemicals will control the\r\n\u201cdisease\u201d and seldom notice they are nearly killing the patient in the process.\r\nA browning azalea flower does not necessarily mean the dreaded petal blight.\r\nSome years ago a Westcott article on possible azalea troubles appeared in\r\nprint about the time azalea blooms in a Northern region were turning brown\r\nfrom a combination of unusual weather conditions. Some gardeners immediately assumed the worst, thought that the southern blight had arrived in the\r\nNorth, and started spraying. The poor plants, suffering from drought and\r\na heat wave, suffered additional injury from the additional stress of sprays.\r\nAll chemicals used as sprays or dusts are injurious to plants under some\r\nconditions, the injury varying with the chemical and the dosage, with the\r\nspecies and even the variety of plant, with temperature, soil moisture, and\r\nmany other factors. Plants suffering from drought are commonly injured by\r\nsprays.\r\nSo please, don\u2019t jump to conclusions. Don\u2019t do anything in a hurry because\r\nthe plants are getting sick fast and there is no time for a proper diagnosis. Don\u2019t\r\nrush to the seed store to buy some chemical you vaguely remember reading\r\nabout. Relax! You have all the time in the world for proper identification, since,\r\nby the time the disease is serious enough for you to notice, it is probably too late\r\nfor protective spraying this season anyway.\r\nBrowning of an azalea flower means nothing as a diagnostic symptom. It\r\ncould just as well come from frost, heat, or old age as from a pathogen. If the\r\nflowers are limp and collapsed with a slimy feel, these are good symptoms, but\r\nsigns of the fungus are needed as well. Thin, slightly curved black bodies\r\n(sclerotia) formed at the base of petals are distinctive, but even more conclusive are spores taken from the inside of the petals and examined under\r\nxvii"

If these are one-celled, with a little box-like appendage, then\r\nyou may reasonably conclude that you have the true azalea petal blight.\r\nThis is a book of garden diseases, but it is not expected that anyone,\r\namateur or professional, can read a brief description, look at an unfamiliar\r\ndisease in the garden, and make a very reliable diagnosis. I certainly cannot,\r\nand after compiling this tome I am less likely to try than ever before. I have\r\nwritten \u201cwater-soaked\u201d or \u201creddish brown\u201d too many hundreds of times for\r\ndifferent diseases to make such symptoms seem very distinctive.\r\nHowever, if you are a gardener, you can narrow the field down considerably by consulting \u25b6 Part IV, where host plants are listed in alphabetical\r\norder, and under each the type of disease \u2013Blight, Canker, Leaf Spot,\r\netc. \u2013 and then the organisms causing these diseases by their scientific\r\nnames and the states where they have been reported. Eliminating the types\r\nof disease that are obviously different from yours and eliminating diseases\r\nthat are reported only on the West Coast when you live in New York, you may\r\nfind only two or three possibilities to look up in \u25b6 Part III, which lists, under\r\nthe different disease groups, the pathogens in alphabetical order, followed by\r\na discussion of each disease. In situations where pathogen names have been\r\nchanged due to critical investigations of spore formation and development,\r\nthe original name is listed in alphabetical order followed by \u201csee new name\u201d.\r\nUnder the new name in parenthesis \u201cformerly old name\u201d is indicated.\r\nDon\u2019t let all the scientific names worry you. It is the only way to make this\r\na quick and easy reference, for there are very few common names of plant\r\ndiseases that can be used without confusion. It works just like the telephone\r\nbook. While thumbing your way down to Smith, John, you do not worry about\r\nspelling Smiecinski, C., which you pass on the way.\r\nIf you are a quasi-professional, with little or no formal mycology but trying\r\nto keep abreast of a flood of miscellaneous specimens, there is a brief review\r\nfor you of the salient microscopic characteristics of each genus, together with\r\nits classification. This is in small type and may be readily passed over by those\r\ninterested solely in macroscopic characteristics.\r\nWhat is Plant Disease?\r\nThere are many definitions of plant disease, the simplest being any deviation\r\nfrom the normal. The concept of the late professor H. H. Whetzel, a great\r\nteacher of plant pathology who influenced many students including\r\nDr. Cynthia Westcott, is valid and appropriate even today. \u201cDisease in plants\r\nis an injurious physiological process, caused by the continued irritation of\r\na primary causal factor, exhibited through abnormal cellular activity and\r\nexpressed in characteristic pathological conditions called symptoms.\u201d The\r\ncausal factor may be a living organism or an environmental condition. Injury\r\ndiffers from disease in being due to the transient irritation of a causal factor,\r\nas the wound of an insect, sudden freezing or burning, application of a poison.\r\nPlant diseases may be necrotic, with dying or death of cells, tissues, or\r\norgans; hypoplastic, resulting in dwarfing or stunting; or hyperplastic, with an\r\novergrowth of plant tissue, as in crown gall or club root.\r\nxviii Introduction"

Fossil\r\nremains suggest that plant diseases were present on earth before man himself.\r\nCertainly man has been punished by them ever since the Garden of Eden.\r\n\u201cI smote you with blasting and with mildew and hail in all the labors of your\r\nhands yet ye turned not to me, saith the Lord\u201d (Haggai 2:17).\r\nMan\u2019s attempts at controlling plant disease go back at least to 700 B.C. when\r\nthe Romans instituted the Robigalia to propitiate the rust gods with prayer and\r\nsacrifice. About 470 B.C. Pliny reported that amurca of olives should be\r\nsprinkled on plants to prevent attacks of blight, this being our earliest known\r\nreference to a fungicide, although Homer, 1000 B.C., wrote of \u201cpest-averting\r\nsulfur.\u201d\r\nIn 1660 at Rouen, France, a law was passed calling for eradication of the\r\nbarberry as a means of fighting wheat rust, two centuries before anyone knew\r\nthe true nature of rust or how barberry affected wheat.\r\nIn the latter part of the eighteenth century the Englishman Forsyth discoursed on tree surgery and treatment of wounds and cankers. His seemingly\r\nfantastic recommendation of a paste of cow dung to promote healing of tree\r\nwounds has modern corroboration in research showing that urea speeds up\r\nhealing of such wounds.\r\nMuch of our progress in dealing with plant disease has followed spectacular catastrophes. Modern plant pathology had its start with the blight that\r\nswept the potato fields of Europe in 1844 and 1845, resulting in the Irish\r\nfamine. This lesson in the importance of plant disease to the economic\r\nwelfare of mankind marked the beginning of public support for investigations\r\ninto the cause of disease. Two men, both German, laid the firm foundations of\r\nour present knowledge. Mycologist Anton de Bary, 1867 to 1888, first proved\r\nbeyond doubt that fungi associated with plant diseases were pathogenic,\r\nwhile Julius Kuhn, farmer with a doctor\u2019s degree in science, first showed\r\nthe relation between science and practice in the problems of plant disease\r\ncontrol. His textbook on Diseases of Cultivated Plants, published in 1858, is\r\nstill useful.\r\nThe accidental discovery of bordeaux mixture in France in 1882 marks the\r\nbeginning of protective spraying for disease control, but the use of drugs goes\r\nback to 1824, when sulfur was recommended as an eradicant for powdery\r\nmildew. The development of synthetic organic fungicides was sparked by\r\nWorld War II, partly as a result of a search for chemicals to mildew-proof\r\nfabrics used by the armed forces. Antibiotics for plant disease control\r\nfollowed their use in medical practice, with a great deal of research in this\r\nfield since 1949.\r\nSince the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1972\r\nthere has been increased concern on the use of toxic chemicals for controlling\r\nplant disease. Moreover, this concern has generated renewed interest in\r\nintegrated pest management (IPM) and biological control strategies in the\r\n1980\u2019s. IPM utilizes all available pertinent information regarding the crop or\r\nplant, its pathogens, the environmental conditions expected to prevail,\r\nIntroduction xix"

        "html": "locality, availability of materials, and costs in developing the control program. Biological control is the total or partial destruction of pathogen\r\npopulations by other organisms. This phenomenon occurs routinely in nature.\r\nThere are several diseases in which the pathogen cannot develop because the\r\nsoil, called suppressive soils, contain microorganisms antagonistic to the\r\npathogen, or because the plant that is attacked has been naturally inoculated\r\nbefore or after the pathogen attack, with antagonistic microorganisms. Even\r\nhigher plants may reduce the amount of pathogen inoculum by trapping\r\navailable pathogens (trap plants) or by releasing substances toxic to the\r\npathogen into the soil. Although biological antagonisms are subject to numerous ecological limitations it can be expected to become an important part of\r\ncontrol measures employed against many more diseases in future years.\r\nPlant Pathology in the United States\r\nOrganized plant pathology in the United States started in 1885 with a section\r\nof Mycology in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In 1904 the start of the\r\ngreat epiphytotic of chestnut blight, which was to wipe out our native trees,\r\nstimulated more public interest and support for plant pathology. In 1907 the\r\nfirst university Department of Plant Pathology was established at Cornell\r\nUniversity.\r\nThe United States Quarantine Act of 1912 officially recognized the possibility of introducing pests and diseases on imported plants, after low-priced\r\nnursery seedlings from Europe had brought in the white pine blister rust. This\r\nwas our first attempt at control by exclusion.\r\nIn 1917, during World War I, the Plant Disease Survey was organized as an\r\noffice of the Bureau of Plant Industry \u201cto collect information on plant diseases\r\nin the United States, covering such topics as prevalence, geographical distribution, severity, etc., and to make this information immediately available to\r\nall persons interested, especially those concerned with disease control.\u201d\r\nDuring World War II the Plant Disease Survey was in charge of the emergency project \u201cto protect the country\u2019s food, feed, fiber and oil supplies by\r\nensuring immediate detection of enemy attempts at crop destruction through\r\nthe use of plant diseases and providing production specialists and extension\r\nworkers with prompt and accurate information regarding outbreaks of plant\r\ndiseases whether introduced inadvertently or by design while still in incipient\r\nstages.\u201dAs a by-product of these wartime surveys we accumulated a good\r\ndeal of evidence on the prevalence of new and established diseases across the\r\ncountry, in home gardens as well as on farms.\r\nIn 1946, a century after Phytophthora infestans had made history with the\r\npotato blight, a strain of the same fungus started an unprecedented epiphytotic\r\nof tomato blight. This disaster led to the forecasting service warning dealers\r\nand growers when certain diseases are imminent.\r\nThe Plant Disease Survey has now become the Epidemiology Investigations Section of the Agricultural Research Service of the U.S. Department of\r\nAgriculture. The Agricultural Research Service became a part of the Science\r\nand Education Administration in 1978. It issues a monthly bulletin, The Plant\r\nxx Introduction"

The American Phytopathological Society assumed the\r\nresponsibility for publishing this journal in 1980 and the journal was renamed\r\nPlant Disease. Much of the material in this handbook is taken from these\r\nreports.\r\nPrinciples of Control\r\nControl of a plant disease means reduction in the amount of damage caused.\r\nOur present annual toll from disease is nearly four billion dollars. Perfect\r\ncontrol is rare, but profitable control, when the increased yield more than\r\ncovers the cost of chemicals and labor, is quite possible. Commercial growers\r\nnow average a return of four dollars for each dollar so invested. Keeping\r\nhome plantings ornamental yields a large return in satisfaction and increased\r\nproperty value.\r\nThe five fundamental principles of control are exclusion, eradication,\r\nprotection, resistance, and therapy.\r\n1. Exclusion means preventing the entrance and establishment of pathogens\r\nin uninfested gardens, states, or countries. For home gardeners it means\r\nusing certified seed or plants, sorting bulbs before planting, discarding any\r\nthat are doubtful, possibly treating seeds or tubers or corms before they are\r\nplanted, and, most especially, refusing obviously diseased specimens from\r\nnurseryman or dealer. For states and countries, exclusion means quarantines, prohibition by law. Sometimes restricted entry of nursery stock is\r\nallowed, the plants to be grown in isolation and inspected for one or two\r\nyears before distribution is permitted.\r\n2. Eradication means the elimination of a pathogen once it has become\r\nestablished on a plant or in a garden. It can be accomplished by removal\r\nof diseased specimens, or parts, as in roguing to control virus diseases or\r\ncutting off cankered tree limbs; by cultivating to keep down weed hosts\r\nand deep ploughing or spading to bury diseased plant debris; by rotation of\r\nsusceptible with nonsusceptible crops to starve out the pathogen; and by\r\ndisinfection, usually by chemicals, sometimes by heat treatment. Spraying\r\nor dusting foliage with sulfur after mildew mycelium is present is eradication, and so is treating the soil with chloropicrin to kill nematodes and\r\nfungi.\r\n3. Protection is the interposition of some protective barrier between the\r\nsusceptible part of the suspect or host and the pathogen. In most instances\r\nthis is a protective spray or dust applied to the plant in advance of the\r\narrival of the fungus spore; sometimes it means killing insects or other\r\ninoculating agents; sometimes it means the erection of a windbreak or\r\nother mechanical barrier.\r\n\u25b6 Part I gives an alphabetical list of chemicals used in present-day\r\nprotective spraying and dusting, along with eradicant chemicals, and\r\nincludes notes on compatibility and possibilities of injury. It is here\r\nthat home gardeners, sometimes commercial growers, can do their plants\r\nirreparable harm instead of the good they intend. Spraying is never to be\r\nIntroduction xxi"

Nature has always eliminated the unfit, but since\r\nabout 1890 man has been speeding up the process by deliberately breeding,\r\nselecting, and propagating plants resistant to the more important diseases.\r\nResistant ornamental plants have lagged behind food plants, but we do have\r\nwilt-resistant asters, rust-resistant snapdragons, wilt-resistant mimosas. Here\r\nis the ideal way for home gardeners to control their plant diseases \u2013 in the\r\nwinter when the seed order and the nursery list is made out \u2013 so easy, and\r\nso safe!\r\n5. Therapy is control by inoculating or treating the plant with something that\r\nwill inactivate the pathogen. Chemotherapy is the use of chemicals to\r\ninactivate the pathogen, whereas heat is sometimes used to inactivate or\r\ninhibit virus development in infected plant tissues so that newly developing tissue may be obtained which is free of the pathogen. The use of this\r\nprocedure is discussed in \u25b6 Part II.\r\nxxii Introduction"

It may\r\nbe an eradicant, applied to a plant, plant part, or the environment as a curative\r\ntreatment to destroy fungi established within a given area or plant; or preferably it may be a protectant, applied to protect a plant or plant part from\r\ninfection by killing, or inhibiting the development of, fungal spores of\r\nmycelium that may arrive at the infection court. A bactericide is a\r\nsubstance that destroys or inhibits bacteria and nematicide for nematodes.\r\nAmong the more recent bactericides are antibiotics, products of other living\r\norganisms. They also have value against certain fungi. There are few\r\nvirocides, which are toxic or poisonous to viruses.\r\nA pesticide is any chemical that is used to kill pests, especially insects\r\nand rodents.\r\nAn insecticide is an agent used to kill insects.\r\nA disinfectant is an agent that frees a plant or plant part from infection by\r\ndestroying the pathogen established within it. A disinfectant kills or inactivates organisms present on the surface of the plant or plant part or in the\r\nimmediate environment. Chemicals for seed treatment can be either\r\neradicants or protectants, but most of them are disinfestants, in that they kill\r\norganisms on the surface of the seed rather than those within. In common\r\nusage, however, they are called disinfectants.\r\nA nematicide is, of course, a chemical that kills nematodes in the soil or in\r\nthe plant. Most nematicides are fumigants, chemical toxicants that act in\r\nvolatile form.\r\nNot so long ago the chemicals on the garden medicine shelf consisted\r\nof copper and sulfur for protectants, lime sulfur as an eradicant, mercuric\r\nchloride as a disinfectant, and formalin and carbon bisulfide as\r\nfumigants. You sometimes got plant injury; you did not always get the best"

        "html": "possible control, but at least you did not have to be an organic chemist. Now\r\nwe have the following classes of fungicides:\r\nInorganic Organic\r\nSulfur\r\nCopper\r\nSalts\r\nDithiocarbamates\r\nThiazoles\r\nTriazines\r\nSubstituted\r\nAromatics\r\nDicarboximides\r\nDinitrophenols\r\nQuinones\r\nAntibiotics\r\nOrganotins\r\nAliphatic\r\nNitrogens\r\nBenzimidazoles\r\nSterol Inhibitors\r\nStrobilurins\r\nThe search for new fungicides goes on, with hundreds of synthetic organic\r\ncompounds being screened each year. This screening is often a cooperative\r\nventure between manufacturers, state experiment stations, and the U.S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture. After safety precautions for the operator and the\r\nenvironment, and the effectiveness of a compound for certain diseases have\r\nbeen determined, the chief question is whether the material is phytotoxic, that\r\nis, injurious to plants, at concentrations required for control. Phytotoxicity is\r\nan elusive factor, not to be pinned down in a few tests. It varies not only with\r\nthe kind of plant but with the particular variety, the amount of moisture in the\r\nsoil when the spray is applied, the temperature, whether or not the application\r\nis followed by rain or high humidity, the section of the country, and the\r\ncompatibility of the chemical with spreaders or wetting agents, as well as with\r\nother fungicides or insecticides. Coordinated tests with new materials in\r\nmany different states are extremely valuable. Some compounds give rather\r\nuniform results over the country; others vary widely with climatic conditions.\r\nThe 1947 Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)\r\nprovides that all fungicides must be registered with the U.S. Department of\r\nAgriculture before being marketed. Materials highly toxic to humans must be\r\nprominently marked, instructions given for avoiding injury to plants or\r\nanimals, the toxicant chemical named, and the percentage of active and\r\ninactive ingredients given. All labels submitted for registration must be\r\naccompanied by proof that the claims for performance are valid.\r\nIn 1954, Public Law 518, known as the Miller Bill, was passed, providing\r\nfor tolerances. A tolerance is the legal limit of a poisonous residue, expressed\r\nin parts per million (ppm), that may remain on an edible product at the time it\r\nis distributed for consumption. In 1958, The Food Additives Amendment was\r\npassed, which also controls pesticides residues in processed foods. It included\r\nthe Delaney clause, which states that any chemical found to be a carcinogen in\r\nlaboratory animals may not appear in a human food, a zero tolerance. In 1959,\r\nthe FIFRA was amended to include nematicides, plant growth regulators,\r\n2 I Garden Chemicals and Their Application"

        "html": "defoliants, and desiccants as pesticides. Since that time, poisons and repellents used against all classes of animals (from invertebrates to mammals)\r\nhave been brought into the approval process.\r\nFIFRA was further amended in 1972 as the Federal Environmental Pesticide Control Act (FEPCA), making violations by growers, applicators, or\r\ndealers subject to heavy fines and/or imprisonment. All pesticides had been\r\nclassified into either general-use or restricted-use categories by October 1977,\r\nwith anyone applying restricted pesticides required to be state-certified.\r\nPesticide manufacturing plants are to be registered and governmentinspected. All pesticide products must be registered whether shipped in\r\ninterstate or intrastate commerce. Other provisions are of various degrees of\r\nimportance to concerned persons or companies.\r\nAdditional modifications were made in FIFRA in 1989. The modifications\r\nspecifically will (1) accelerate re-registration of older pesticides (those registered prior to November 1984) and impose fees on chemical manufacturers\r\nfor re-registration; (2) essentially eliminate indemnification payments to\r\nthose holding inventories of suspended or canceled pesticides, except farmers\r\nand certain end users; and (3) shift part of the burden for storage and disposal\r\nof banned pesticides from the government to the manufacturer. The 1989\r\nFIFRA also empowers the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to\r\nchange regulations on how applicators handle, rinse, and dispose of pesticide\r\ncontainers. The Worker Protection Standard (WPS), passed in 1992, required\r\nlabels to carry re-entry intervals (REI) and personal protection equipment for\r\ncertain end-uses. Labels having both WPS and non-WPS uses are required to\r\nhave recommendation for PPE and REI for both categories.\r\nIn 1996, the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA)was passed, requiring\r\na 10 year review process of all currently registered pesticides based on a risk\r\ncap of aggregate exposure, in other words all possible ways people, particularly children, can come into contact with pesticides whether through residues\r\non food or backyard applications. Part of FQPA determined that an acceptable\r\nlevel of risk is a reasonable certainty of no harm, essentially eliminating the\r\nDelaney Clause from 1958. The FQPA also provided for accelerated registrations of safer pesticides, such as biological control organisms or active\r\ningredients with the potential for minimal environmental impact.\r\nThe federal government considers these to be minimum pesticide regulations. Any state may choose to establish more rigid pesticide regulations\r\nwithin its boundaries than those legislated by the federal government, and\r\nsome have done so. Some states require notification to be posted prior to\r\ncommercial pesticide application including chemicals used. Thus, pesticide\r\napplicators must be familiar with individual state pesticide regulations as well\r\nas federal pesticide regulations.\r\nConsumers, therefore, are well protected against fraud, but they must\r\nbe willing to read the fine print on labels if they are to choose intelligently\r\nfrom the bewildering array of proprietary compounds on dealers\u2019 shelves. In\r\nthe following pages there are lists of available products, cross-referenced\r\nby product name and the common name of active ingredients. In many\r\ncases, several product names may exist for the same active ingredient; those\r\nreadily available to consumers may not be listed so pay particular attention to\r\nGarden Chemicals and Their Application 3"

        "html": "Applying The Chemicals\r\nSpraying is the application of a chemical to\r\na plant in liquid form; dusting the application of\r\na fine dry powder. The difference between\r\nspraying and dusting was very clear-cut before\r\naerosol bombs, mist blowers, and fog machines\r\nwere developed to apply liquids in such concentrated form that the particles are practically dry\r\nbefore they reach the plant and before spraydusters were made to deliver wetted dusts.\r\nSprayers vary from a flit gun or pint atomizer,\r\nwhich takes an hour to discharge a gallon, to\r\npower apparatus that discharges 60 gallons a\r\nminute at 800 pounds pressure from a 600-gallon\r\nspray tank. Dusters vary from the small\r\ncardboard or plastic carton in which the dust is\r\npurchased to helicopters. Applicators for pressurize sprays or aerosols vary from the one-pound\r\n\u201cbomb\u201d to truck-mounted fog generators or air\r\nblast machines. See Fig. 1 for various applicators.\r\nMist Sprayers\r\nIn orchards and in shade tree work there has been\r\nincreasing use of mist blowers, air blast machines\r\nthat carry droplets of concentrated pesticides to\r\nplants in air rather than water. They are speedier\r\nthan hydraulic sprayers, use far less water, which\r\nmay be scarce in times of drought, and do not\r\nleave puddles or poisonous run-off which may be\r\ndangerous to pets and birds. They cannot, however, be operated in much wind; for that reason,\r\nand also in order to see the distribution of the\r\nconcentrates, they often have to be used at night.\r\nThey are not too efficient for very tall trees, and\r\nthe droplet size has to be rather carefully regulated. Too large drops may fall out before they\r\nreach a tree, and too small drops may not settle\r\ndown but go on past.\r\nAlthough we usually think of mist blowers on\r\ntrucks for large scale operations, there are now\r\nsome about the size of knapsack sprayers that,\r\nengine and all, are worn on the back around the\r\ngarden. They weigh around 35 pounds and will\r\ncover foliage up to 30 feet. They cost, however,\r\nsomewhat more than the hydraulic power\r\nsprayers of small estate size.\r\nHydraulic Sprayers\r\nMist blowers will probably never entirely outmode hydraulic sprayers, which can place the\r\nspray more accurately, at a greater height, and\r\ncan operate under more unfavorable weather conditions. For trees, high gallonage per minute and\r\nenough pressure to drive sprays high in the air\r\nhave advantages, but for garden plants the\r\nemphasis should be on cutting down gallonage\r\nand pressure.\r\nPower sprayers for home gardens are available\r\nin almost any size, from 5-gallon capacity on up,\r\nand may have gasoline or electric motors\r\n(see Fig. 2).

        "html": "you start with a mist nozzle with a small hole at the\r\nbeginning of the season, you will soon be delivering more spray per minute because the hole is\r\nenlarging. This usually means more conspicuous\r\nresidue left on the plant as well as more expense.\r\nHand-Operated Sprayers\r\n\u201cAerosol bombs\u201d are pressurized sprays in pushbutton containers. A gas propellant reduced to\r\nliquid form is added to a pesticide concentrate\r\nand a fine mist is released when the button is\r\npushed. Unless the container is held 12 to 18\r\ninches away from plants, to allow the gas to\r\nevaporate, there will be some burning (more literally a freezing) when the liquid gas hits foliage.\r\nSuch cans are good for house plants and for spot\r\ntreatment of insects outdoors, but air currents\r\nmake it difficult to place fungicides effectively.\r\nAerosols are also used for the application of\r\nwound dressings to trees. (See Fig. 3).\r\nHousehold sprayers of the atomizer type are\r\nintermittent, discharging spray material with\r\neach forward stroke of the pump, or continuous,\r\nmaintaining constant pressure. They are too small\r\nand too tiresome to operate for more than a few\r\nplants, and it is hard to get adequate coverage of\r\nunderside of foliage.\r\nCompressed air sprayers are adequate for\r\nsmall gardens and are relatively inexpensive.\r\nCapacity varies from 1 to 6 gallons. They are\r\nmeant to be carried slung over one shoulder, but\r\nsome come mounted on a cart. Air is compressed\r\ninto the tank above the spray liquid by a\r\nhand-operated pump. A short hose, extension\r\nrod, and adjustable nozzle make it possible\r\nto cover undersurfaces. Such sprayers are a bit\r\nhard to pump up, and some models have\r\ncarbon dioxide cylinders to provide operating\r\npressure.\r\nKnapsack sprayers, of 2 to 6 gallons capacity,\r\nare carried on the back of the operator and are\r\npumped by moving a lever up and down with the\r\nright hand as you spray with the left. These are\r\nmore expensive than compressed air sprayers, but\r\ndeliver a fine continuous mist and are excellent\r\nfor larger gardens.\r\nSlide or trombone sprayers have a telescoping\r\nplunger, operated with two hands. They draw\r\nmaterial from an attached jar or separate pail\r\nand discharge it as a continuous spray. They\r\ndevelop good pressure and can be used for small\r\ntrees, but are tiring to use.\r\nWheelbarrow sprayers are manually operated\r\nhydraulic sprayers, holding 7 to 18 gallons, that\r\nare mounted on a frame with wheelbarrow-type\r\nhandles and one or two wheels. Pressures up to\r\n250 pounds may be developed, providing excellent coverage for shrubs and small trees. This\r\ntype works best with two people, one to control\r\nthe pump, the other to operate the spray rod.\r\nHose-end sprayers are attached to the garden\r\nhose so that water supplies the pressure. The\r\naction is that of a siphon. The concentrated\r\npesticide is placed in a jar, and as water under\r\npressure is passed over the metering jet a small\r\namount of chemical is drawn into it. This is a\r\nvery easy way to spray, and some models are\r\nrelatively accurate in materials discharged. Be\r\nsure to purchase a type with an extension tube\r\nand deflector, so that spray can be directed to\r\nunderside of the foliage, with a shut-off at the\r\njar, not just back at the hose, and with a device\r\nto prevent back-siphonage. Hose-end sprayers\r\ncan be used for roses and other shrubs and\r\nfor low trees. The droplets may be somewhat\r\nlarger than those from a wheelbarrow or\r\nknapsack sprayer, and slightly more chemical\r\nmay be used.\r\nFigure 3 Pesticide application equipment (Modified\r\nfrom the National Sprayer and Duster Association)\r\nHand-Operated Sprayers 21"

        "html": "Dusters\r\nPesticide dusts are most often made with talcs,\r\npyrophyllite, clays, calcium carbonate, precipitated hydrated silicates and silicon dioxides, synthetic calcium silicate and diatomaceous earth as\r\nthe diluents although finely ground plant material\r\nsuch as tobacco dust or walnut shell flour is\r\nsometimes used.\r\nIn some cases, a solution of the toxicant in a\r\nvolatile organic solvent such as acetone or\r\nbenzene is mixed with the dust diluents, the solvent allowed to evaporate, and the mixture then\r\nground. A solution of toxicant may be sprayed on\r\nthe dust diluent during mixing and grinding or the\r\ntoxicant dissolved in a nonvolatile solvent and\r\nmixed with the diluent. When this is done, care\r\nmust be taken to avoid an excess of solvent that\r\nmight impair dusting qualities of the finished\r\nproduct. Many technical pesticides in solid form\r\nlend themselves to direct grinding with a sorptive\r\nclay carrier in adequate milling equipment. Field\r\nstrength dusts may be produced by diluting or\r\ncutting down dust concentrates which contain\r\nfrom 10 to 50 % a.i. (Dust Bases). Because of their\r\ngood dusting properties, attapulgites, diatomite,\r\ntalc, pyrophyllite, kaolins, and treated calcium\r\ncarbonate are used as diluents to provide the\r\nvolume per acre needed to facilitate metering of\r\nthe dust through the duster mechanism. Since\r\nmany formulations contain more than one a.i.,\r\ndry concentrates must have the proper qualities\r\nto make a good formulation with relatively little\r\nor no diluent. From a toxicity standpoint, it is\r\ndesirable to have a very small particle size, since\r\nimmediate toxicity is generally inversely proportional to particle size. There are several important\r\ndisadvantages to extremely small particle size:\r\nhigh wind losses, more or less rapid volatilization\r\nand the prohibitive cost of extremely fine grinding. Also, to obtain better toxicant exposure of\r\ntechnical concentrates absorbed on a carrier, it is\r\ndesirable to have the extender or diluent in as large\r\na particle size as possible and still give good\r\ndusting characteristics. In a 5 % dust effective\r\ntoxicant exposure is obtained with the extender\r\naveraging 10 times the size of the toxicant particles. At present, particle size specifications are\r\nusually 10 to 30 mm for ground dusters and 20 to\r\n40 mm for aircraft units. For use in fertilizer mixtures, granulated powders of 20 to 80 mesh are\r\nprepared by impregnation of Fuller\u2019s earth and\r\nbentonite fractions with the desired toxicants.\r\nSome dusts are sold in a can with a shaker top,\r\nmeant to be applied like salt, which is certainly\r\nnot going to place a fungicide where it will do the\r\nmost good. Some dusts are sold in small cardboard cylinders to be used as dusters, which work\r\nfor a little while if the cardboard is well\r\nparaffined to slide easily; but the dust soon gets\r\ndamp and clogs. Many more dusts are sold in\r\nplastic containers, with the dust supposedly coming out in clouds as you squeeze, but more often it\r\ndoesn\u2019t after the first few days. Dusts are tricky to\r\nuse because of these disadvantages.\r\n22 Applying The Chemicals"

        "html": "Spraying Vs Dusting\r\nThere is really no answer to the question of\r\nwhether it is better to dust or to spray. In most\r\ngardens you will do both, depending on the\r\nweather, the plant, the fungicide you want to\r\nuse, and how much time and help you have.\r\nSome orchardists prefer dusting because they\r\ncan get around the trees quickly in a rain, whereas\r\nto apply a spray they must wait until the foliage is\r\ndry. But for ornamentals exactly the opposite is\r\ntrue! You cannot dust a shrub even slightly wet\r\nwith rain or dew without having a hideous\r\nsplotchy effect that persists for a long time. If\r\nabsolutely necessary you can spray while the\r\nplants are still slightly wet, though the spray may\r\nnot stick quite as well, and you may want to make\r\nthe next application a bit sooner. It is easier to\r\nspray than to dust on a windy day. Also, in dusting\r\nyou are somewhat more likely to get possibly\r\ntoxic materials into your lungs than in spraying.\r\nThe chief points in favor of dusting are the ease\r\nand speed of application and the fact that you do\r\nnot have to clean out the duster after each dusting.\r\nSprayers have to be cleaned, often between\r\ndifferent sprays, and they must be rinsed with at\r\nleast two changes of water pumped through the\r\nsystem at the end of every day. Occasionally they\r\nmust be taken apart, the tank soaked in trisodium\r\nphosphate or washing soda, the strainers and nozzles in kerosene, wire run through the spray rods,\r\nthen all put together and rinsed with water.\r\nR.K.

        "html": "Mixing The Chemicals\r\nIt still seems incredible that so many gardeners\r\ncontinue to treat their plants in a haphazard\r\nfashion. Buy a set of measuring spoons and\r\na measuring cup, marked in ounces. Buy a large\r\npail and mark it off in gallons. Then measure,\r\nexactly!\r\nDosage directions are usually given in pounds\r\nper 100 gallons of water, with or without translation on the label into small amounts. Not much\r\narithmetic is required to figure a smaller dosage,\r\nif you remember a few measurements:\r\nConversion table\r\n3 teaspoons \u00bc 1 tablespoon\r\n2 tablespoons \u00bc 1 fluid ounce\r\n16 tablespoons, 8 fluid ounces \u00bc 1 cup\r\n16 ounces, 2 cups \u00bc 1 pint\r\n2 pints, 4 cups \u00bc 1 quart\r\n16 cups, 8 pints \u00bc 4 quarts \u00bc 1 gallon\r\n1 acre \u00bc 43,560 square feet\r\nSuppose 3 gallons of a 2 to 100 dilution of lime\r\nsulfur is desired. That is the same as a 1 to 50\r\ndilution. Three gallons constitute 48 cups; so if 1\r\ncup of liquid lime sulfur is added to 3 gallons, you\r\nwill have a 1 to 49 dilution, and that is close\r\nenough.\r\nOr suppose you want to make 4 gallons of\r\nZineb at the rate of 1 1/2 pounds per 100 gallons.\r\nThat is 24 ounces per 100 gallons, or .24 ounce for\r\n1 gallon and .96 ounce for 4 gallons. That is\r\napproximately 1 ounce to weigh on your small\r\nscales. It also works out at about 1 level tablespoon\r\nof the Dithane powder per gallon, and it is easier to\r\nmeasure than to weigh. There is, however, a good\r\ndeal of volume variation, depending on how\r\nfluffed up the material is at the time you measure\r\nit; so weighing is preferable.\r\nWhen you buy chemicals in small packages\r\ndesigned for the home garden, the dosages\r\ngiven on the labels will probably be in terms\r\nof tablespoons per gallon, and you need only\r\nfollow directions. When, to save a good deal of\r\nexpense, you buy the larger sizes intended for\r\nfarmers, the directions may be given only in\r\nterms of pounds per 100 gallons. As a very\r\nrough rule of thumb, you can figure 1 tablespoon per gallon where directions call for 1\r\npound per 100 gallons, but the different mixtures have different weights so this is not very\r\naccurate.\r\nAt the rate of 1 pound to 100 you would use,\r\naccurately, 3/4 T captan 50 %, 1 T chloranil\r\n(Spergon), 1/3 T copper sulfate, 2/3 T dichlone\r\n50 % (Phygon), 1 1/4 T ferbam, 1/2 T maneb,\r\n1 T spray lime, 3/4 T thiram, 1/2 T sulfur,\r\n2/3 T zineb (Dithane Z-78 or Parzate), 1 1/4 T\r\nziram to 1 gallon of water.\r\nSometimes materials for soil treatment are\r\ngiven in pounds per acre. Knowing that one\r\nacre contains 43,560 square feet, you can\r\nmake a proportion to find out how many pounds\r\nare required per 1,000 square feet.\r\nR.K.

The diminished availability of pesticides\r\nmay limit choices to more costly materials. In\r\naddition, there is growing concern about groundwater contamination by pesticides and fertilizers,\r\nconsumer exposure to pesticide residue on food\r\nand plant material, pesticide resistance in plant\r\npathogens, insects and weeds, destruction of beneficial organisms, atmospheric contamination by\r\npollutants, and concern for endangered species,\r\nall of which combine to make the problem of pest\r\ncontrol more serious.\r\nFor the past 30 years integrated pest management (IPM) has received increased interest.\r\nInvestigations have concentrated on enhancement of a broad arsenal of integrated strategies\r\nfor control of pests and diseases on selected commodities. A key goal of IPM strategies is the\r\nreduction of pesticide use to the absolute minimum and the reliance on other strategies to assist\r\nin controlling pests. IPM strategies which can be\r\nused include:\r\n\u2022 Apply pesticides only when necessary;\r\n\u2022 Make use of application methods that apply\r\nless pesticide or use a more efficient spray\r\nsystem;\r\n\u2022 Use biocompatible chemicals as they become\r\navailable;\r\n\u2022 Use biological controls when available and\r\nwhen appropriate; and\r\n\u2022 Use cultural practices which are favorable to\r\nhealthy plant growth.\r\nA successful IPM program depends on four\r\nbasic techniques.\r\n\u2022 Scouting. Regular and random visual\r\nobservations provide early warning to disease\r\nproblems.\r\n\u2022 Disease Identification. The first and most\r\nimportant step is to identify the problem;\r\nmisdiagnosis results in use of improper\r\ncontrol.\r\n\u2022 Timing. Improper timing of control measure\r\nwill result in disease control failure; the control measure must be timed correctly to the\r\nstage of disease development.\r\n\u2022 Records. Brief accurate records are a good\r\ntool for disease control decisions.\r\nAlthough entomologists have achieved some\r\nsuccess with biological controls, the successes by\r\nplant pathologists with biological control has\r\nbeen somewhat sparse. While use of classical\r\nbiological control has aided pest control, most\r\nbiocontrol products have not yet proved to be\r\npreferred treatments for disease control. Intense\r\nresearch in biological control of root diseases\r\nhas been proceeding in the United States and\r\nin Europe.

The classification of bacteria, fungi, and viruses is somewhat involved and is given here\r\nas a background for the specific descriptions in \u25b6 Part III. There are many\r\nclassifications of bacteria, fungi, and viruses, with numerous disagreements\r\namong mycologists, bacteriologists, virologists and plant pathologists.\r\nNames and groups have been chosen that are widely accepted and most\r\nreadily adapted to the alphabetical requirements of a reference that works\r\nlike a dictionary.\r\nClassification of the bacteria is based on that given in the Volume 1\r\n(1984) and Volume 2 (1986) of Bergey\u2019s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology,\r\nand Laboratory Guide for Identification of Plant Pathogenic Bacteria\r\n(1980) by N.

A. et al. 1996. Virus of\r\nPlants. Descriptions and List from the VIDE Database, Van Regenmortel\r\net al. 1999. Virus Taxonomy. 7th Report.

        "html": "Classification in accordance with convention or law is called taxonomy.\r\nCommon names vary from locality to locality and country to country. Scientific names are international and are based on the binomial system. Each kind\r\nof bacterium, fungus, nematode, or higher plant is a species, and it has two\r\nLatin words for its name. The first name indicates the genus to which the\r\nspecies belongs, and the second the species itself. The latter name is usually\r\ndescriptive. Diplocarpon rosae means that Diplocarpon, the blackspot fungus, is found on rose. Sometimes the species name honors a person, as\r\nConiothyrium wernsdorffiae for the fungus causing brand canker of rose.\r\nSuch a species name, derived from a proper name, has sometimes been\r\nwritten with a capital, but present custom is to decapitalize all species\r\nnames. The names of genera should always be written with a capital.\r\nCorrectly, the author of the name should be written after the species. Then,\r\nif someone else places the species in a new genus, the name of the first author\r\nis put in parentheses followed by the name of the second author. When\r\na number of taxonomists have worked on a group, the list of authors gets\r\nquite unwieldy. For simplicity all authors have been omitted from the scientific names in this text. The correct name for a fungus with more than one\r\nstage is that first given, with a valid description, for the teleomorph or sexual\r\nstage. That rule is followed here with a few exceptions\u2013as when a fungus is\r\nalmost universally recognized by another name.\r\nSpecies are grouped into genera, related genera into families, designated\r\nwith the suffix aceae, as Erysiphaceae, and families into orders with the suffix\r\nales, as Erysiphales. Groups of related orders form classes.\r\nStrange as it may seem, scientists are not yet agreed on what constitutes\r\na plant or even a living organism. The old definition of bacteria as unicellular\r\nplants is disputed, and some question if fungi are truly plants. Bacteria are\r\nprokaryotes. Prokaryotes are generally single-celled microorganisms that\r\nhave a cell membrane or a cell membrane and a cell wall surrounding the\r\ncytoplasm and no organized nucleus. Eukaryotes contain membrane-bound\r\nnuclei, mitochondria and \u2013 in plants only \u2013 chloroplasts. Although viruses are\r\nknown to multiply inside their hosts or vectors, the question of their being\r\na living entity has not been resolved. The arguments continue. Meanwhile\r\nentities have to be grouped into some sort of order. Whittaker in 1969\r\nintroduced the five kingdom classification for all living organisms: Monera\r\n(or Procaryota), Protista, Animalia, Plantae and Fungi (or Mycota). The\r\nMonera are organisms with small cells lacking nuclei, mitochondria and\r\nplastids, viz. the bacteria. The Protista include Microorganisms with onecelled, often motile thalli (cells contain nuclei). The plants, animals and fungi\r\nare believed to have evolved from Protista. The Fungi are characterized as\r\nheterotrophic organisms, dependent on organic food, which they absorb. The\r\nfollowing scheme, adapted from the Plant Pathogenic Fungi, Nova Hedwigia\r\n87: 288 pp. by J. A. von Arx, is an attempt to show the position of fungal plant\r\npathogens in the Kingdom Mycota. The listing of families is restricted to\r\nthose containing such pathogens.\r\n32 II Classification of Plant Pathogens"

More than 8,000 species cause\r\nplants disease. Fungi are divided into three kingdoms and eleven phyla.\r\nKingdom: Fungi\r\nPhylum: Chytridiomycota\r\nPhylum: Zygomycota\r\nPhylum: Ascomycota\r\nPhylum: Basidiomycota\r\nKingdom: Stramenopila\r\nPhylum: Oomycota\r\nPhylum: Hyphochytriomycota\r\nPhylum: Labyrinthulomycota (slime molds)\r\nKingdom: Protists\r\nPhylum: Plasmodiophoromycota (endoparasitic\r\nslime molds)\r\nPhylum: Dictyosteliomycota (Dictyostelid slime\r\nmolds)\r\nPhylum: Acrasiomycota (Acrasid slime molds)\r\nPhylum: Myxomycota (true slime molds)\r\nOomycetes, Zygomycetes and\r\nChytridiomycetes were formerly listed as\r\nsubclasses within the class Phycomycetes.\r\nOomycota, Zygomycota and Chytridiomycota\r\nare now generally accepted as separate phyla\r\nof fungi. The mycelium of these three phyla has\r\nmany nuclei which are not marked off by crosswells (or nonseptate mycelium) except where\r\nreproductive structures arise, a condition known\r\nas coenocytic. Asexual reproduction is by means\r\nof spores borne in sacs called sporangia. The\r\nZygomycota have sexual spores called zygospores which are formed by the union of two\r\nsimilar sex cells or gametes; the Oomycota have\r\nsexual spores called oospores formed from dissimilar gametes; the Chytriodiomycota have neither type of sexual spore; the Ascomycota have\r\nseptate mycelium and sexual spores in asci; the\r\nBasidiomycota have septate mycelium, frequently with clamp connections, and sexual\r\nspores; the Myxomycota have thalli as a motile\r\nmass of protoplasm (a plasmodium or\r\nmyxamoeba \u2013 no mycelium) which is\r\ntransformed into a mass of small, aseptate\r\nresting spores that on germination form motile\r\ncells with or without flagella. The Myxomycota\r\ninclude protists with amoeboid thalli and their\r\nstatus as fungi often has been questioned. The\r\nthalli of the Myxomycota are naked, amoeboid,\r\nplasmotic masses without cell walls and are\r\ntermed plasmodia or pseudoplasmodia. They are\r\nalso able to move by the formation of pseudopodia and by plasma-streaming. The Plasmodiophoromycetes is the only class of the\r\nMyxomycota which includes parasites of vascular plants. The best known species is\r\nPlasmodiophora brassicae, which causes \u201cclub\r\nroot\u201d of cabbage.\r\nR.K.

After meiosis, the\r\nhaploid cells are formed exogenously by budding\r\nand are called basidiospores or sporidia. Endogenous spores (sporangiospores or ascospores) are\r\nabsent in Basidiomycota.\r\nThe structures on which haploid spores\r\nresulting from meiosis are formed are termed\r\nbasidia and usually bear a constant number of\r\nspores, 2 or 4, occasionally more. The basidia\r\nare differentiated on dikaryotic hyphae usually\r\nin or on fruiting bodies called basidiomata. The\r\nbasidia may also be formed on resting spores\r\ncalled teliospores (see Fig. 4). Dikaryotic resting\r\nspores may also germinate with a shorter or longer\r\ntube, which is termed promycelium. The three\r\nclasses now distinguished are the Ustomycetes,\r\nthe Urediniomycetes and the Basidiomycetes.\r\nThe Ustomycetes propagate mainly by budding cells; septate hyphae may be present, but\r\nare rare. After meiosis, resting spores form\r\nshort, often septate promycelia, which produce\r\nbudding cells laterally or terminally. Characteristic basidia or basidiospores are absent.\r\nThe Urediniomycetes form basidia, which\r\nafter meiosis form uninucleate cells by transverse\r\nseptation. Each cell forms a single, stalked\r\nbasidiospore.\r\nNearly all Uredinomycetes are obligate parasites of vascular plants and are known as rust fungi.\r\nThe Basidiomycetes form basidia, which usually remain aseptate after meiosis; the basidiospores are arranged in an apical whorl and are\r\nsessile or stalked. The septa of the hypha have\r\ncharacteristic central pores termed dolipores, with\r\nthickened walls and caps. Dolipores are not present\r\nin the Ustomycetes and the Urediniomycetes.\r\nUstomycetes\r\nUstomycetes include about 500 species belonging to two orders; the plant parasitic Ustilaginales\r\n(smut fungi), and the Sporidiales (red yeasts).\r\n40 Fungi"

Smith, of the\r\nU.S. Department of Agriculture, to do most of the\r\npioneer work in this field and to convince the world\r\nthat bacteria were to blame for so many diseases. He\r\nspent a lifetime in the process, starting with peach\r\nyellows, and going onto a study of crown gall andits\r\nrelation to human cancer. In 1905 the first volume of\r\nhis monumental work Bacteria in Relation to Plant\r\nDiseases was published.\r\nThere are about 80 species of bacteria which\r\ncause plant disease and many of them consisting\r\nof numerous pathovars. Bacterial diseases fall\r\ninto three categories: (1) a wilting, as in cucumber wilt, due to invasion of the vascular system,\r\nor water-conducting vessels; (2) necrotic blights,\r\nrots, and leaf spots, where the parenchyma tissue\r\nis killed, as in fire blight, delphinium black spot,\r\nsoft rot of iris and other plants with rhizomes or\r\nfleshy roots; (3) an overgrowth or hyperplasia, as\r\nin crown gall or hairy root.\r\nPathogenic bacteria apparently cannot enter\r\nplants directly through unbroken cuticle but get in\r\nthrough insect or other wounds, through stomata,\r\nthrough hydathodes, possibly through lenticels,\r\nand often through flower nectaries. They can survive for some months in an inactive state in plant\r\ntissue, as in holdover cankers of fire blight, and\r\nperhaps years in the soil, although claims for\r\nextreme longevity of the crown-gall organism in\r\nsoil are discounted.\r\nMost of these plant disease bacteria have had\r\ntheir genus names changed several times since\r\nthey were first described, and some species have\r\nbeen combined. Classification of bacteria will\r\nprobably change further in future years. Where\r\ngenus and/or species names have been changed,\r\nthe old name is given in parentheses. The genera\r\nand species used in this text agree with those given\r\nin Ninth Edition of Bergey\u2019s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology (1994) and recent articles\r\nin the J. Systematic Bacteriology. Walter H.\r\nBurkholder, of Cornell University, who revised\r\nthe portions of the Manual dealing with plant\r\npathogens, followed in the footsteps of Erwin F.\r\nSmith by spending his life with bacterial diseases\r\nof plants, as did Charlotte Elliott of the U.S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, from whose Manual\r\nof Bacterial Plant Pathogens much information on\r\ndisease symptoms have been taken.\r\nTwo kinds of prokaryotes (organisms that lack\r\na true nucleus) cause disease in plants. Bacteria have\r\na cell membrane, a rigid cell wall, and often one or\r\nmore flagella. The mollicutes, or phytoplasmas lack\r\na cell wall and have only a single-unit membrane.\r\nR.K.

Bacteria in\r\nall genera are pleomorphic rods and form yellow colonies that are slow growing.

        "html": "Viruses, Viroids, Phytoplasmas\r\nViruses\r\nThe word virus means poison or venom. When it\r\nis used in connection with a plant disease, it\r\nmeans a filterable virus, an infective principle or\r\netiological agent so small it passes through filters\r\nthat will retain bacteria. Virus diseases in man\r\nrange from infantile paralysis to the common\r\ncold and in plants from \u201cbreaking\u201d of tulip\r\nflowers to the deadly raspberry ringspot disease\r\non the Malling Jewel variety of raspberry.\r\nViruses are obligate parasites in that they are\r\ncapable of increasing only in living cells. They\r\nare not organisms in the usual sense because they\r\ndo not multiply by growth and fission, and they\r\nare too complex to be chemical molecules. F. C.\r\nBawden, in the 1964 edition of his Plant Viruses\r\nand Virus Diseases, defines viruses as \u201csubmicroscopic infective entities that multiply only\r\nintracellularly and are potentially pathogenic.\u201d\r\nVirus diseases are old; our knowledge of them\r\nis relatively recent. Tulip mosaic, shown as\r\nbreaking of flower color, was described in\r\na book published in 1576. In 1892 it was shown\r\nthat the cause of tobacco mosaic could pass\r\nthrough a bacteria-proof filter, and in 1935\r\na crystalline protein was prepared from tobacco\r\nmosaic virus juice. At present we believe that\r\nvirus particles contain only two major components, nucleic acid embedded in a protein structure, and that they are built of uniform-sized\r\nsubunits arranged in a fixed and regular manner.\r\nMany plant viruses contain ribonucleic acid\r\n(RNA). Some plant viruses and many animal\r\nviruses contain deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)\r\ninstead of RNA. X-ray diffraction and electron\r\nmicroscopy have shown something of the morphology of virus particles. Some are rods, some\r\nfiliform, and some are isometric, but polyhedral\r\nrather than spherical. They apparently act not as\r\norganisms but as disturbances in the host metabolism of nucleic acid.\r\nThere are over 850 described plant virus species. Many of the described viruses are definitive\r\nmembers of genera, whose names have been\r\napproved by the ICTV (International Committee\r\non Taxonomy of Viruses) to be viruses and could\r\nbe agents of other kinds. For example, aster yellows and elm phloem necrosis were thought for\r\nsome time to be caused by viruses, but have now\r\nbesen determined to be caused by phytoplasmas.\r\nMoreover, in Part 4 some phytoplasma may still\r\nbe positioned under bacterial or viral caused disease since their true identity is not yet known or\r\nthat the confirmation of identity has been made\r\nbut missed for inclusion in the 7th edition. In\r\naddition, potato spindle tuber and chrysanthemum stunt disease were long thought to be caused\r\nby viruses, but have now been determined to\r\nbe caused by viroids. Viroids consist solely of\r\nsmall RNAs with no protein coat. There are now\r\nabout 30 plant diseases that have been identified\r\nas having viroid causal agents including potato\r\nspindle tuber, chrysanthemum stunt, citrus\r\nexocortis, chrysanthemum chlorotic mottle, and\r\ncadangcadang of palm. More diseases caused by\r\nviroids will probably be identified in future years.\r\nThere are now about 68 identified phytoplasmas\r\nR.K.

        "html": "and finally, some plant diseases formerly thought\r\nto be caused by viruses have now been determined to be caused by spiroplasma, such as citrus\r\nstubborn disease. Thus the field of virology has\r\nchanged somewhat in recent years. In order to\r\nsimplify the discussion of these viruses and viruslike agents and the diseases they cause, these\r\nagents are grouped under virus diseases, since\r\nthe symptoms which they cause in plants are\r\nsimilar.\r\nSome viruses attack a large number of different plants and are of great economic importance;\r\nothers are confined to a single host. Virus symptoms fall into several categories, but commonly\r\nthere is loss of color due to the suppression of\r\nchlorophyll development. Foliage may be mottled green and yellow, mosaic, or have yellow\r\nrings (ring spot); or there may be a rather uniform\r\nyellowing (yellows). Stunting is common. The\r\nreduction in manufactured food from the chlorophyll loss leads to smaller size, shorter internodes, smaller leaves and blossoms, and\r\nreduced yield. There may be various distortions\r\nof leaves and flowers, witches\u2019 brooms, or\r\nrosettes. There may be necrotic symptoms with\r\ndeath as the end result, and sometimes symptoms\r\nare \u201cmasked,\u201d not showing up under certain conditions, such as hot weather, or latent, not\r\nappearing until another virus is also present.\r\nViruses are transmitted from plant to plant by:\r\ninsects, mites, fungi, and nematodes; rubbing,\r\nabrasion, or other mechanical means (sometimes\r\nhandling tobacco and merely touching a healthy\r\nplant spreads mosaic); grafting or propagation by\r\ncuttings and bulbs; occasionally seeds; sometimes soil and water; and dodder, parasitic vines\r\nwhose tendrils link one plant to another. About\r\nhalf of the insect vectors are aphids; a third are\r\nleafhoppers. Mealybugs and whiteflies transmit\r\nsome viruses, and six, including tomato spotted\r\nwilt, are transmitted by thrips. In some cases the\r\nvirus multiples within the insect as well as in the\r\nplant. Some viruses have many different vectors,\r\n50 being recorded for onion yellow dwarf, and\r\nsome have but a single known vector.\r\nControl of virus diseases starts with obtaining\r\nhealthy seed, cuttings, or plants. \u201cCertified\u201d\r\nmeans that plants have been inspected during\r\nthe growing season and found free of\r\ncertain diseases. Virus-free foundation stock\r\ncan be built up from heat treatment \u2013rowing\r\nplants at high temperatures for weeks or even\r\nmonths \u2013 and/or meristem tip cultured plants.\r\nVirus-free stock is tested by \u201cindexing\u201d, bioassays and/or serological assays, before using stock\r\nfor propagating. Controlling insect vectors (by\r\nspraying plants or treating soil with systemic\r\ninsecticides), eliminating weed hosts, roguing\r\ndiseased plants before insects can transmit the\r\nvirus, and using resistant varieties are all ways\r\nof combating virus diseases.\r\nThis handbook does not deal predominantly\r\nwith the characteristics of the causal viral agent,\r\nbut with the disease caused by the virus, viroids\r\nand phytoplasmas.\r\nViruses are classified now in the traditional\r\ntaxonomic system (family \u2013 genus \u2013 species).\r\nFormal use of a virus species name should be\r\nprinted in italics with the first word capitalized;\r\nan acronym, when used, should also be capitalized. In this book however, we used bold font for\r\nthe generic name of viruses. Generally, the species name consists of the vernacular plus the\r\ngeneric names. For example, Tomato spotted\r\nwilt tospovirus is the species name, tomato\r\nspotted wilt virus is the vernacular name and\r\nTospovirus the generic name. The scheme of\r\nvirus and viroid classification (shown below)\r\naccording to Murphy et al. (1995) and Brunt\r\net al. (1996) include the following data: genus\r\nof virus, family (if designated), kind of nucleic\r\nacid in genome, shape of virions, presence of\r\nenvelope and the type species:\r\nAlfamovirus\r\nBromoviridae; (+)ssRNA; isometric particles;\r\nnot enveloped; alfalfa mosaic virus.\r\nAlphacryptovirus\r\nPartitiviridae; dsRNA; isometric particles; not\r\nenveloped; white clover cryptic virus 1.\r\n50 Viruses, Viroids, Phytoplasmas"

At the beginning of \u25b6 Part IV you will find a list of headings\r\nunder which diseases are grouped and described, from Anthracnose to\r\nWitchweed. In the Host section, \u25b6 Part IV, the key word, for example, rot\r\nor blight, is given in capital and small capitals, followed by the name of\r\nthe pathogen (agent causing disease) in boldface. In this Diseases section,\r\nChap. 3, the pathogens are listed in boldface in alphabetical order under\r\neach heading such as ROTS or BLIGHTS and so on, followed by the common\r\nname of the disease. This system was adopted for quick and easy reference\r\nbecause trying to alphabetize hundreds of similar common names would lead\r\nto endless confusion. Also, it allows a very brief summary of the classification\r\nand diagnostic characters of each genus before going on to a consideration\r\nof diseases caused by the various species. This brief summary is in small\r\ntype, so that it can be readily skipped by readers uninterested in the technical\r\ndetails. Perhaps I am the only one who feels the need for this quick review, to be\r\nused in conjunction with the classification given in \u25b6 Part II; perhaps others\r\nwho have to answer questions over a broad field instead of their own specialty\r\ncan make use of these capsules sandwiched in between nontechnical\r\ndescriptions.\r\nAn alphabetical arrangement has the great disadvantage of being thrown\r\nout of alignment every time the name of a fungus is changed, as it so\r\nfrequently is. In some such cases the old name is retained to avoid change\r\nin order, but the present accepted name is also given. Sometimes names have\r\nbeen changed under several hosts and the old name inadvertently retained\r\nunder others. And sometimes the old name is purposely retained because it is\r\nso familiar to everyone. This is particularly true of a few fungi far better\r\nknown by their anamorph states than by the correct name of the teleomorph\r\nstate. A fungus not only can have several names; it also can cause more than\r\none type of disease. For instance, Pellicularia filamentosa is the present name\r\nof the fungus formerly known as Corticium vagum when causing Rhizoctonia\r\nrot of potatoes and Corticium microsclerotia when causing web blight of\r\nbeans. As Rhizoctonia solani, the name given to the sclerotial stage, the same"

The word was coined in France\r\nfor the latter type, to differentiate a grape disease\r\nfrom a smut of cereals, both of which were called\r\ncharbon. The new word was taken from the\r\nGreek Anthrax (carbuncle) and nosos (disease),\r\nand was first used for the grape disease, caused by\r\nSphaceloma ampelina, the chief symptom of\r\nwhich was a bird\u2019s-eye spot with a raised border.\r\nA disease of brambles, raspberry and blackberry, was then named anthracnose because it\r\nlooked like the grape disease. The fungus, however, instead of being correctly placed in the\r\ngenus Sphaceloma, was mistakenly named\r\nGloeosporium venetum. The next disease entering the picture was a bean trouble, and, because\r\nthe fungus was identified as Gloeosporium\r\n(though later transferred to the genus\r\nColletotrichum), this common bean disease with\r\ntypical necrotic symptoms was also called\r\nanthracnose and came to typify diseases so\r\ndesignated.\r\nThe term \u201cspot anthracnose\u201d has been given to\r\nthose diseases similar to the original hyperplastic\r\ngrape disease. Those with slight hyperplastic\r\nsymptoms are still commonly called anthracnose,\r\nand those with pronounced overgrowth of tissue\r\nare commonly called scab. Both types are caused\r\nby the genus Elsinoe\u00a8, anamorph state\r\nSphaceloma, and are treated, in this revised text,\r\nas a separate group. \u25b6 Spot Anthracnose.\r\nAnthracnose in the modern sense is a disease\r\ncharacterized by distinctive limited lesions on\r\nstem, leaf, or fruit, often accompanied by dieback\r\nand usually caused by a Gloeosporium or\r\na Colletotrichum, anamorph fungi producing\r\nslime spores oozing out of fruiting bodies\r\n(acervuli) in wet, pinkish pustules. These spores\r\n(conidia) on germinating form an appressorium\r\n(organ of attachment) before entering the host\r\nplant. The teleomorph state of the fungus, when\r\nknown, is Gnomonia or Glomerella (see Fig. 1).\r\nApiognomonia\r\nApiognomonia errabunda (Anamorph,\r\nGloeosporium quercinum).

Sycamore Anthracnose,\r\nTwig Blight, general on American and Oriental\r\nplanes (London plane is rather resistant) and on\r\nCalifornia and Arizona sycamores. The fungus\r\nwinters as mycelium in fallen leaves, producing\r\nperithecia that discharge ascospores when young\r\nfoliage is breaking out. Mycelium also winters in\r\ntwig cankers. Young sycamore leaves turn brown\r\nand die, looking as if hit by late frost. Leaves\r\ninfected later in the season have irregular brown\r\nareas along the veins. Conidia ooze out from\r\nacervuli on underside of veins in flesh-colored\r\nmasses, in rainy weather, and are splashed to\r\nother leaves. Twigs and branches have sunken\r\ncankers with more acervuli. Native sycamores\r\nmay be nearly defoliated, with smaller twigs\r\nkilled. Larger branches die with several successive wet springs. The trees usually put out\r\na second crop of leaves after defoliation, but\r\nthis is a devitalizing process.

Symptoms appear late in\r\nthe season, causing more loss to canning crops.\r\nSmall, circular sunken spots, increasing to an\r\ninch in diameter, penetrate deeply into the flesh.\r\nAt first water-soaked, the spots turn dark, with\r\npinkish, cream, or brown spore masses in the\r\ndepressed centers, often arranged in concentric\r\nrings. The disease is worse in warm, moist\r\nweather. The fungus winters in tomato refuse,\r\nsometimes in cucumber and melon debris.\r\nControl Clean up trash and rotting fruit.\r\nColletotrichum pisi (Glomerella cingulata).\r\nPea Anthracnose, Leaf and Pod Spot commonly\r\nassociated with Ascochyta blight and often\r\na secondary parasite.\r\nColletotrichum schizanthi Anthracnose on\r\nbutterfly-flower. Symptoms are small brown\r\nspots on leaves and water-soaked areas on\r\nyoung stems.

See also under \u25b6 Cankers and\r\nDiebacks and under \u25b6 Rots.\r\nOn citrus, orange, lemon, grapefruit there is\r\na dying back or withertip of twigs. Leaf spots are\r\nlight green turning brown, with pinkish spore pustules prominent in wet weather. Decayed spots are\r\nproduced on ripening fruits in storage. Similar\r\nwithertip symptoms may also appear on avocado,\r\naucuba, cherimoya, fig, loquat, roselle,\r\nrosemallow, royal palm, dieffenbachia, rubberplant, strawberry and other ornamentals and fruits.\r\nThe disease has also been reported on European\r\nwhite birch in Virginia. Lack of water and nutrient\r\ndeficiency predispose plants to infection by this\r\nweak parasite. The fungus attacks blue lupine and\r\nstatice or sea-lavender; peach anthracnose became\r\nimportant in Georgia when lupine was used as\r\na ground cover in orchards. Sweet pea anthracnose\r\nis often more severe near apple orchards where the\r\nfungus winters on cankered apple limbs and in\r\nbitter rot mummies. Whitish lesions disfigure\r\nsweet pea leaves, shoots, and flower stalks. Leaves\r\nwither and fall; stalks dry up before blossoming;\r\nseed pods shrivel. There may be general wilting\r\nand shoot dieback.\r\nAnthracnose and twig blight are widespread\r\non privet. Leaves dry and cling to the stem; cankers at the base of stems are dotted with pink\r\npustules. Bark turns brown and splits; death follows complete girdling of stems. European privet\r\nis highly susceptible; California, Amur, Ibota,\r\nand Regal privets are fairly resistant.

Twigs wither and shrivel from one inch\r\nto several inches back from the tip; young leaves\r\nhave dead areas or are distorted; buds fail to open\r\nand may drop; fruits drop, or are misshapen, or\r\nhave shallow spots or depressed cankers.\r\nControl Spray with bordeaux-oil emulsion as\r\nfruit is setting, with two or three applications of\r\n1 to 40 lime sulfur at 7\u201314 day intervals.\r\nGlomerella cingulata (formerly Gloeosporium\r\napocryptum). Maple Anthracnose Leaf Blight, an\r\nimportant leaf disease of silver maple, common\r\nalso on other maples and boxelder, appearing from\r\nlate May to August. The leaf spots are light brown,\r\noften merging with the leaves, appearing scorched.\r\nThe effect may be confused with the physiological\r\nscorch caused by hot weather. On Norway maples\r\nthe leaf lesions are confined to purple to brown\r\nlines along the veins.

It may also affect lima bean, Scarlet\r\nrunner, tepary, mung, kudzu, and broad beans, and\r\ncowpea. It is worldwide in distribution, known in\r\nthe United States since 1880. There are at least 34\r\nstrains of the fungus, in three different groups, but\r\nthe disease has decreased in importance with the\r\nuse of western-grown, anthracnose-free seed.\r\nThe most conspicuous symptoms are on the pods,\r\nsmall, brown specks enlarging to black, circular,\r\nsunken spots, in moist weather showing the typical\r\npinkish ooze of the slime-spores. Older spots often\r\nhave narrow reddish borders. After the spores are\r\nwashed away, the acervuli look like dark pimples. If\r\npods are infected when young, the disease extends\r\nthrough to the seed, which turns yellow, then rusty\r\nbrown or black under the pod lesion. The infection\r\nmay extend deep enough to reach the cotyledons.\r\nLeaf lesions are dark areas along veins on underside\r\nof the blade and on petioles. Seedlings may show\r\nstem spotting below diseased cotyledons. The fungus is spread by splashing rain, tools, and gardeners\r\nworking with beans when they are wet. Optimum\r\ntemperature is between 63\u0001 and 75 \u0001F, with maximum around 85 \u0001F.\r\nControl Use western-grown seed. Saving homegrown seed is dangerous unless you can be sure of\r\nselecting from healthy plants and pods. Clean up,\r\nor spade under, old bean tops; rotate crops.

In hairy root a great\r\nnumber of small roots protrude either directly\r\nfrom stems or roots or from localized hard swellings that frequently occur at the graft union. The\r\ndisease is common on grafted nursery apple trees\r\n1, 2, or 3 years old, and the root development may\r\nbe as profuse as witches\u2019 broom. Control measures are the same as for crown gall.\r\nAgrobacterium rubi Cane Gall of brambles, on\r\nblackberry, black and purple raspberries, and,\r\nvery rarely, red raspberry. Symptoms appear on\r\nfruiting canes in late May or June as small,\r\nspherical protuberances or elongated ridges of\r\nwhite gall tissue, turning brown after several\r\nweeks.

        "html": "commonly at the graft union, but sometimes on\r\nroots or aerial parts. On euonymus, galls are\r\nformed anywhere along the vine. This is primarily a disease of the parenchyma, starting with\r\na rapid proliferation of cells in the meristematic\r\ntissue and the formation of more or less convoluted soft or hard overgrowths or tumors. The\r\nclose analogy of the unorganized cell growth of\r\nplant galls to wild cell proliferation in human\r\ncancer has intrigued scientists for many years.\r\nIn some fashion bacteria provide stimulus for\r\nthis overdevelopment, but similar galls have\r\nbeen produced on plants experimentally by\r\ninjecting a virus or growth-promoting substances.\r\nEntrance of bacteria into plants for natural\r\ninfection is through wounds. In nurseries and\r\norchards nematodes, the plow, the disc, or the\r\nhoe may be responsible; on the propagating\r\nbench grafting tools are indicted. Many claims\r\nhave been made for the longevity of crown gall\r\nbacteria in soil, but it now seems to be established\r\nthat they do not live in the absence of host plants\r\nmore than a couple of years, and that sudden\r\noutbreaks of crown gall on land not previously\r\ngrowing susceptible crops are due to irrigation\r\nwater bringing in viable bacteria from other\r\ninfected orchards. The addition of lime to the\r\nsoil may encourage crown gall, for bacteria do\r\nnot live in an acid medium. The period of greatest\r\nactivity is during the warm months.\r\nControl For home gardens rigid exclusion of all\r\nsuspected planting stock is the very best control.\r\nDo not accept from your nurseryman blackberries,\r\nraspberries, roses, or fruit trees showing suspicious\r\nbumps. If you have had previous trouble, choose\r\na different location for new, healthy plants. Be\r\ncareful not to wound stems in cultivating.\r\nFor nurserymen, sanitary propagating practices are a must. Stock should be healthy.\r\nGrafting knives should be sterilized by frequent\r\ndipping in 10 % Chlorox solution, 1 ounce in 2\r\ngallons of water, or in denatured alcohol. If nursery soil is infested, 2 years\u2019 growth of cowpeas,\r\noats, or crotalaria between crops will minimize\r\ncrown gall.\r\nFruit and nut growers can perhaps plant less\r\nsusceptible varieties, although fruit that is resistant in one locality may be diseased in another.\r\nAmerican grape varieties are considered more\r\nresistant than European. Apples may be better\r\non mahaleb root-stock, nut trees on black walnut\r\nunderstock. Budding rather than grafting reduces\r\nthe chance of infection.\r\nPainting galls with a solution of Elgetolmethanol has given control of crown gall on\r\npeaches and almonds in California. One part\r\nElgetol (sodium dinitrocresol) is shaken with 4\r\nparts synthetic wood alcohol and applied with\r\na brush, covering the surface of the gall and\r\nextending 1/2 inch to 1 inch beyond the margin\r\ninto healthy bark.\r\nCoryneform Group Mycobacteriaceae\r\nClavibacter\r\nSlender, straight to slightly curved rods, with\r\nirregularly stained segments or granules, often\r\nwith pointed or club-shaped swellings at ends;\r\nFig. 1 Crown Gall on Rose\r\n70 Bacterial Diseases"

Fermenting\r\ntomato pulp for 4 days at a temperature near\r\n70 \u0001F will destroy bacteria on surface of seed;\r\nhot-water treatment, 25 min at 122 \u0001F will kill\r\nsome, perhaps not all, of internal bacteria. Start\r\nseedlings in soil that has not previously grown\r\ntomato.\r\nClavibacter poinsettiae (see Curtobacterium\r\nflaccumfaciens pv. poinsettia). Stem Canker and\r\nLeaf Spot of Poinsettia, a relatively new disease,\r\nfirst noted in greenhouses in 1941.\r\nClavibacter sepedonicum (see Clavibacter\r\nmichiganense subsp. sepedonicum). Bacterial\r\nRing Rot of potato, widespread since 1931,\r\nwhen it probably was introduced from Europe.\r\nClavibacter michiganense subsp.\r\nsepedonicum (formerly Clavibacter\r\nsepedonicum). Bacterial Ring Rot of potato,\r\nwidespread since 1931, when it probably was\r\nintroduced from Europe. All commercial varieties are susceptible, with losses formerly in millions of dollars in decay of tubers in field and\r\nstorage. Now a single infected plant in a potato\r\nfield disqualifies the whole field for certification.\r\nSymptoms appear when plants are nearly full\r\ngrown, with one or more stems in a hill wilted\r\nand stunted while the rest seem healthy. Lower\r\nleaves have pale yellow areas between veins;\r\nthese turn deeper yellow, and margins roll\r\nupward. A creamy exudate is expelled when the\r\nstem is cut across. This bacterium may also occur\r\nin sugar beet which are symptomless.\r\nTuber infection takes place at the stem end,\r\nand the most prominent symptoms appear some\r\ntime after storage. The vascular ring turns creamy\r\nyellow to light brown, with a crumbly or cheesy\r\nodorless decay followed by decay from secondary organisms. Bacteria are not spread from plant\r\nto plant in the field, but by cutting knife and\r\nfingers at planting. A knife used to cut one\r\ninfected tuber may contaminate the next 20 seed\r\npieces.\r\nControl Use certified seed potatoes. Use several\r\nknives and rotate them in disinfestant. Commercial growers use a rotating knife passed through\r\na chemical or hot-water bath between cuts.\r\nCoryneform Group Mycobacteriaceae 71"

The bark is shrunken, dark brown to\r\npurplish, sometimes blistered with gum oozing\r\nout. Brown or black blighted branches with dead\r\npersistent leaves look as if scorched by fire. The\r\nbacteria survive the winter in living tissue at the\r\nedge of \u201choldover cankers\u201d on limbs. These are\r\ndead, slightly sunken areas with a definite margin\r\nor slight crack where dead tissue has shrunk away\r\nfrom living. In moist weather bacteria appear on\r\nthe surface of cankers in pearly viscid drops of\r\nooze, which is carried by wind-blown rain or\r\ninsects to blossoms. Infection spreads from the\r\nblighted bloom to the young fruit, then down the\r\npedicel to adjacent leaves, which turn brown,\r\nremaining hanging around the blighted blossom\r\ncluster. Leaf and fruit blight is also possible by\r\ndirect invasion, a secondary infection via bacteria\r\ncarried from primary blossom blight by ants,\r\naphids, flies, wasps, fruit-tree bark beetles, and\r\nhoneybees, sometimes tarnished plant bugs, and\r\npear psyllids.\r\nThe tissue first appears water-soaked, then\r\nreddish, then brown to black as the bacteria\r\nswarm between the dying parenchyma cells.\r\nDivision may take place every half hour; so they\r\nmultiply rapidly and are usually well in advance\r\nof discolored external tissue. A collar rot may\r\ndevelop when cankers are formed near the base\r\nof a tree. Water sprouts are common sources of\r\ninfection.\r\nAs spring changes to summer, the bacteria\r\ngradually become less active and remain dormant\r\nat the edge of a woody canker until the next\r\nspring at sap flow. Ordinarily they do not winter\r\non branches smaller than 1/2 inch in diameter.\r\nControl Spraying during bloom is now\r\na standard means of preventing blossom blight.\r\nUse bordeaux mixture or a fixed copper or streptomycin at 60 to 100 ppm. The latter is very\r\neffective at relatively high temperatures; at\r\n65 \u0001F and below, copper is more satisfactory.\r\nStart spraying when about 10 % of the blossoms\r\nare open and repeat at 5-to 7-day intervals until\r\nlate bloom is over. A dormant spray for aphid\r\ncontrol helps in preventing fire blight.

Long present in southern Arizona, this\r\ndisease was not described until 1942, after it had\r\nencroached on cactus parks and private estates.\r\nMany giant cacti in the Saguaro National Monument have been killed, with heaviest mortality in\r\ntrees 150 to 200 years old.\r\nSymptoms start with a small, circular, light\r\nspot, usually with a water-soaked margin. The\r\ntissues underneath turn nearly black; the spot\r\nenlarges and has a purplish hue with the center\r\ncracking and bleeding a brown liquid. The rotten\r\ntissues dry, break up into granular or lumpy\r\npieces, and fall to the ground. Rotting on one\r\nside means leaning to that side; when the trunk\r\nis girdled near the base, the giant is likely to fall in\r\na wind-storm. If it does not break, it stands as\r\na bare, woody skeleton, with all parenchyma\r\ntissue disintegrated. An insect, Cactobrosis\r\nfernaldialis, is largely responsible for the rapid\r\nspread of the disease. The larvae tunnel inside the\r\nstems most of the year, emerging from May to\r\nAugust to pupate for a month or so before the\r\nadult, a tan and brown nocturnal moth, lays eggs.\r\nControl A phosphate dust, applied monthly from\r\nApril to September, has effectively controlled the\r\ninsect vector. Incipient infections can be cut out\r\nand the cavity allowed to dry out and cork over.\r\nBefore the insect vector was known, fallen trees\r\nwere cut into short lengths, dragged to a burial\r\npit, covered with a disinfectant, and then with\r\nsoil.\r\nErwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora (formerly Erwinia carotovora).

Besides wide distribution on iris, soft rot has been reported, among\r\nornamentals, on chrysanthemum, dahlia, Easter\r\nlily, geranium, orchid, sansevieria, poinsettia,\r\nand yellow calla.\r\nThe bacteria enter through wounds, causing\r\na rapid, wet rot with a most offensive odor. The\r\nmiddle lamella is dissolved, and roots become\r\nsoft and pulpy. Soft rot in iris often follows\r\nborer infestation. Tips of leaves are withered,\r\nthe basal portions wet and practically shredded.\r\nThe entire interior of a rhizome may disintegrate\r\ninto a vile yellow mess while the epidermis\r\nremains firm. The rot is more serious in shaded\r\nlocations, when iris is too crowded or planted too\r\ndeeply.\r\nControl Borer control, starting when fans are\r\n6 inches high, has greatly reduced the incidence\r\nof rot. If it appears, dig up the clumps, cut away\r\nall rotted portions, cut leaves back to short fans.\r\nAllow to dry in the sun for a day or two, then\r\nreplant in well-drained soil, in full sun with upper\r\nportion of the rhizome slightly exposed. Many\r\ngood iris growers do not agree with this \u201csitting\r\nduck\u201d method, preferring to cover with an inch of\r\nsoil; but the sun is an excellent bactericide, and\r\nshallow planting is one method of disease control.

First evidence of blight is a gray watersoaked area mid-point on the stem, followed by\r\nrot and falling over. The diseased tissue is brown\r\nor reddish brown; the rot progresses downward to\r\nthe base of the stem or, under unfavorable conditions, may be checked with axillary buds below\r\nthe diseased area producing normal shoots. Cuttings rot at the base. Sometimes affected plants do\r\nnot show external symptoms, and cuttings taken\r\nfrom them spread the disease. Bacteria can be\r\nspread via cutting knife, or fingernails in\r\npinching, and can live several months in soil.\r\nA form of this species causes a leaf blight of\r\nphilodendron and may also infect banana, carnation, corn, and sorghum and pith/stem rot of\r\ntomato.\r\nControl Snap off cuttings; sterilize soil and\r\ntools.\r\nCorn rot.

A watersoaked dark discoloration of the heartwood is\r\ncorrelated with chronic bleeding at crotches and\r\nwounds and abnormally high sap pressure in\r\ntrunk, with wilting a secondary symptom. The\r\npressure in diseased trees increases from April\r\nto August or September, reaching 5 to 30 pounds\r\nper square inch (as much as 60 pounds in one\r\nrecord). The bacteria inhabit ray cells mostly and\r\ndo not cause a general clogging of waterconducting tissues. This pressure, caused by fermentation of tissues by bacteria, causes fluxing,\r\na forcing of sap out of trunks through cracks,\r\nbranch crotches, and wounds. The flux flows\r\ndown the trunk, wetting large areas of bark and\r\ndrying to a grayish white incrustation. Bacteria\r\nand yeasts working in the flux cause an offensive\r\nodor that attracts insects.\r\nControl Bore drain holes through the wood\r\nbelow the fluxing wound, slightly slanted to facilitate drainage. Install 1/2-inch copper pipe to\r\ncarry the dripping sap away from the trunk and\r\nbuttress roots. Screw the pipe in only far enough\r\nto be firm; if it penetrates the water-soaked wood,\r\nit interferes with drainage.\r\nErwinia rhapontica Rhubarb Crown Rot, similar to soft rot.\r\nErwinia stewartii (see Pantoea stewartii).

Total loss of\r\nvines is rare, but a 10 to 20 % loss is common.\r\nThis is a vascular wound disease transmitted\r\nby striped and 12-spotted cucumber beetles. Dull\r\ngreen flabby patches on leaves are followed by\r\nsudden wilting and shriveling of foliage, and\r\ndrying of stems. Bacteria ooze from cut stems in\r\nviscid masses.

This is a vascular disease with yellow slime\r\nformed in the water-conducting system, resulting\r\nin browning of nodes, and dwarfing of plants; or\r\nlong pale green streaks on leaf blades, followed\r\nby wilting and death of whole plant. Tassels may\r\nbe formed prematurely and die before the rest of\r\nthe plant. The bacteria are chiefly disseminated\r\nby corn flea beetles, and winter either in the\r\nbeetles or in seed. Primary infections come from\r\nflea beetles feeding in spring, from infected seed,\r\nand occasionally from soil; but secondary spread\r\nis mostly by insects.\r\nCorn grown in rich soil is more susceptible to\r\nwilt, and so are early varieties, especially Golden\r\nBantam. Winter temperatures influence the\r\namount of wilt the following summer. If the winter index, which is the sum of mean temperatures\r\nfor December, January, and February, is above\r\n100, bacterial wilt will be present in destructive\r\namounts on susceptible varieties. If the index is\r\nbelow 90, the disease will be very sparse in\r\nnortheastern states; if the index is between 90\r\nand 100, there will be a moderate amount of\r\nwilt. Disease surveys over a period of years testify to the reliability of such forecasts (based on\r\nthe amount of cold the flea beetle vectors can\r\nsurvive); but with the increasing use of hybrid\r\nsweet corn resistant to wilt, the importance of\r\nwinter temperatures is reduced.\r\nControl Use insecticides to control flea beetles;\r\nsubstitute commercial fertilizer for manure;\r\ndestroy infected refuse; try treating seed with\r\nterracmycin or streptomycin.

It is one of the most serious\r\ncrucifer diseases, present each season but epidemic in warm, wet seasons.\r\nThe bacteria invade leaves through water\r\npores or wounds and progress to the vascular\r\nsystem. Veins are blackened, with leaf tissue\r\nbrowning in a V-shape. With early infection\r\nplants either die or are dwarfed, with a onesided growth. Late infection results in defoliation, long bare stalks with a tuft of leaves on\r\ntop. When stems are cut across, they show\r\na black ring, result of the vascular invasion, and\r\nsometimes yellow bacterial ooze. Black rot is\r\na hard odorless rot, but it may be followed by\r\nsoft, odorous decays. Primary infection comes\r\nfrom bacteria carried on seed, or in refuse in\r\nsoil, but drainage water, rain, farm implements,\r\nand animals aid in secondary infection.\r\nControl Use seed grown in disease-free areas in\r\nthe West or treat with hot water, 122 \u0001F, 25 min\r\nfor cabbage, 18 min for broccoli, cauliflower, and\r\ncollards. Plan a 3-year rotation with plants other\r\nthan crucifers, and clean up all crop refuse.\r\nXanthomonas campestris Horse-Radish Leaf\r\nSpot.

Hyacinth Yellows, yellow rot of Dutch hyacinth, occasionally\r\nentering the country in imported bulbs.\r\nThe disease was first noted in Holland in 1881\r\nand named for the yellow slime or bacterial ooze\r\nseen when a bulb is cut. The bulbs rot either\r\nbefore or after planting, producing no plants\r\nabove ground or badly infected specimens,\r\nwhich do not flower and have yellow to brown\r\nstripes on leaves or flower stalks. Bacteria are\r\ntransmitted by wind, rain, tools, and clothes,\r\nwith rapid infection in wet or humid weather,\r\nparticularly among luxuriantly growing plants.\r\nThe disease is usually minor in our Pacific Northwest but worse in warm, wet weather on rapidly\r\ngrowing plants.

American elms may be attacked at\r\nany age; they wilt and die suddenly within 3 or\r\n4 weeks or gradually decline for 12 to 18 months.\r\nThis is now thought to be caused by\r\na mycoplasma-like agent. Transmission is by\r\nthe white-banded elm leafhopper (Scaphoideus\r\nluteolus) and possibly other species. Nymphs hatch\r\nabout May 1 from eggs wintered on elm bark and\r\nfeed on leaf veins. Adults move from diseased to\r\nhealthy trees.\r\nThere is hope of propagating elms resistant to\r\nphloem necrosis. Communities should interplant\r\nexisting elms with Asiatic or European varieties\r\nor with some other type of tree to provide shade if\r\nand when present elms die.\r\nPeach Western X-Disease Perhaps same as\r\nX-disease but usually treated separately; also\r\nknown as cherry buckskin and western-X little\r\ncherry. The pathogen is transmitted by leafhoppers (Colladonus germinatus, Fieberella florii,\r\nOsbornellus borealis, and others) to peach, nectarine and cherry in western states. Symptoms\r\nvary according to rootstock, but cherry fruit is\r\nsmaller than normal. Sour cherries are puttylike,\r\npinkish; sweet cherries are small, conical, hang\r\non trees late, fail to develop normal color. Symptoms on peach are similar to those of X-disease.\r\nPeach X-Disease On peach and chokecherry,\r\nsometimes cherry in the northern United States\r\nand of major importance in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York. Peach trees appear normal in spring for 6 or 7 weeks after growth starts,\r\nthen foliage shows a diffused yellow and red\r\ndiscoloration with a longitudinal upward curling\r\nof leaf edges; spots may drop out, leaving\r\na tattered effect. Defoliation starts by mid-summer. Fruits shrivel and drop or ripen prematurely.\r\nSeed do not develop. Weakened trees are killed\r\nby low temperatures or remain unproductive.\r\nChokecherry has conspicuous premature reddening of foliage, dead embryos in fruit. The\r\nsecond and third seasons after infection foliage\r\ncolors are duller, there are rosettes of small leaves\r\non terminals, and death may follow. Natural\r\ninfection is apparently from chokecherry to\r\npeach (not peach to peach or peach to chokecherry) by a leafhopper (Colladonus clitellarius).\r\nElimination of chokecherries within 500 feet of\r\npeach trees provides the best control.\r\nPeach Yellow Leaf Roll; a form of Western\r\nX-Disease; perhaps caused by a more severe\r\nstrain of the MLO.\r\nPeach Yellows; Little Peach. First noted near\r\nPhiladelphia in 1791 and so serious that in 1796\r\nthe American Philosophical Society offered\r\nMycoplasmataceae 89"

The fungus was first\r\nnoticed in Germany in 1791; the disease was\r\nreported in France in 1849, and in the United\r\nStates in 1910. It is generally distributed east of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains and formerly caused from\r\n50 to 90 % loss.

The leaves sometimes turn purple and\r\nwilt, but there is no defoliation, as in black rot.\r\nThe fungus reaches the soil via infected plant\r\ndebris, remaining alive 2 or more years. Spores\r\nare spread by splashing rain, or manure, on tools,\r\nand perhaps by insects, with new lesions resulting\r\nin 10 to 14 days. But the chief spread is by\r\nmycelium wintering in infected seed.

This section is\r\nlimited to the rose disease. Delphinium black spot\r\nwill be found under Bacterial Diseases, elm black\r\nspot under Leaf Spots, other black spots under\r\nBlack Mildew.\r\nDiplocarpon\r\nAscomycetes, Helotiales,\r\nDermateaceae (Mollisiaceae)\r\nApothecia innate, formed in dead leaves, but\r\nat maturity rupturing overlying tissues; horny to\r\nleathery with a thick margin or outer wall\r\n(excipulum) of dark, thick-walled cells; spores\r\ntwo-celled, hyaline; paraphyses present. Anamorph\r\nstate is a Marssonina with two-celled hyaline spores\r\nin an acervulus.\r\nDiplocarpon rosae Rose Blackspot, general\r\non rose but less serious in the semi-arid\r\nSouthwest; reported from all states except\r\nArizona, Nevada, and Wyoming.\r\nFor nearly 100 years the fungus was known\r\nonly by its anamorph state, which has had about\r\n25 different names. The first definite record is by\r\nFries in Sweden in 1815, under the name\r\nErysiphe radiosum, but the first valid description\r\nwas by Libert in 1827 as Asteroma rosae. Later\r\nFries called it Actinonema rosae, and that term\r\nwas widely used until Actinonema species were\r\ntransferred to Marssonina. The blackspot fungus\r\nwas first reported in the United States in 1831,\r\nfrom Philadelphia, and in 1912 Wolf made the\r\nconnection with the teleomorph state, so that the\r\ncorrect name became Diplocarpon rosae.\r\nBlackspot is probably the most widely distributed and best known rose disease. It is confined to\r\nroses, garden and greenhouse, and may affect practically all varieties, although not all are equally\r\nsusceptible. There has been some progress made\r\nin breeding resistant varieties, but recent investigation disclosing many physiological races of the\r\nfungus explains why roses that are almost immune\r\nto blackspot in one location may succumb in\r\nanother. Rosa bracteata is the only species thus\r\nfar shown to be reasonably resistant to all the\r\ndifferent races tested. Roses with the Pernetiana\r\nparentage, which has given us the lovely yellows,\r\ncoppers, and blends, are especially prone to\r\nblackspot. Some roses, like Radiance, are tolerant\r\nof blackspot, usually holding their leaves, even\r\nthough they cannot be considered resistant.\r\nSymptoms are primarily more or less circular\r\nblack spots, up to 1/2 inch in diameter, with\r\nradiating fimbriate or fringed margins (see\r\nFig. 1). This fimbriate margin is a special diagnostic character, differentiating blackspot from\r\nother leaf spots and from discolorations due to\r\ncold or chemicals. The spots vary from one or two\r\nto a dozen or more on a leaf, usually on the upper\r\nsurface. With close examination you can see\r\nsmall black dots or pimples in the center of the\r\nspots. These are the acervuli, bearing conidia, and\r\nthey glisten when wet (see Fig. 2).\r\nR.K.

        "html": "In susceptible varieties the appearance of\r\nblack spots is soon followed by yellowing of\r\na portion or all of leaflets and then by defoliation.\r\nThe leaf fall is apparently correlated with\r\nincreased production of ethylene gas in diseased\r\ntissue and perhaps by a difference in auxin gradient between leaf and stem. Some roses lose\r\nalmost all their leaves, put out another set and\r\nlose those, and often are trying to leaf out for the\r\nthird time by late summer. The process is so\r\ndevitalizing that some bushes may die during\r\nthe following winter. On tolerant varieties leaf\r\nspots are present, though usually in smaller\r\nnumbers, but there is much less yellowing and\r\ndefoliation. Cane lesions are small indistinct\r\nblack areas, slightly blistered, without fimbriate\r\nmargins.\r\nInfection occurs through either leaf surface,\r\nthe fungus sending its germ tube directly through\r\nthe cuticle by mechanical pressure. The hyphae\r\nform a network under the cuticle, joining together\r\ninto several parallel filaments radiating from the\r\npoint of infection. The hyphae are actually colorless, the black color of the spot coming from the\r\ndeath and disorganization of host cells. The\r\nmycelial growth is between cells, with haustoria\r\n(suckers) invading epidermal and palisade cells\r\nfor nourishment.\r\nAcervuli, summer fruiting bodies, formed just\r\nunder the cuticle, bear two-celled hyaline conidia\r\non short conidiophores on a thin, basal stroma.\r\nSplashed by rain or overhead watering, or spread\r\nby gardeners working among wet plants, the\r\nconidia germinate and enter a leaf if there is\r\ncontinued moisture for at least 6 h. Rain, heavy\r\ndew, fog, and sprinklers used late in the day so\r\nfoliage does not dry off before night provide the\r\nrequisite moisture. New spots show up within\r\na week and new spores within 10 days. Secondary\r\ncycles are repeated all summer \u2013 from late May to\r\nlate October around New York City.\r\nIn my personal experience, the spread of disease\r\nis most rapid where large numbers of susceptible\r\nvarieties are massed together. If all the yellows, for\r\ninstance, are planted together, the disease gets such\r\na head start, and builds up so much inoculum to\r\nspread to the more tolerant red and pink varieties\r\nnearby, that these varieties also are more heavily\r\ninfected than usual. When roses are mixed in beds\r\nso that one or two particularly susceptible bushes\r\nare surrounded by more resistant types, the infecFig. 1 Rose Blackspot.

In spring three types of fruiting\r\nbodies may be formed: microacervuli or spermagonia containing very small cells that perhaps act\r\nas male cells; apothecia, the sexual fruiting bodies formed on a stroma between the epidermis\r\nand palisade cells and covered with a circular\r\nshield of radiating strands; and winter acervuli,\r\nformed internally and producing new conidia\r\nin spring. The Diplocarpon or apothecial stage\r\nis apparently not essential; it is known only\r\nin northeastern United States and south-central\r\nCanada. The shield over the apothecium ruptures,\r\nand the two-celled ascospores are forcibly\r\ndischarged into the air to infect lowest leaves.\r\nWhere the sexual stage is not formed, primary\r\nspring infection comes from conidia splashed by\r\nrain to foliage overhead, from acervuli either in\r\noverwintered leaves on the ground or in cane\r\nlesions. New roses from a nursery sometimes\r\nbring blackspot via these cane lesions to\r\na garden previously free of disease.\r\nControl The importance of sanitation may have\r\nbeen somewhat overstressed; it cannot replace routine spraying or dusting. It is certainly a good idea\r\nto pick off for burning the first spotted leaves, if this\r\nis done when bushes are dry so that the act of\r\nremoval does not further spread the fungus. Raking\r\nup old leaves from the ground at the end of the\r\nseason makes the garden neater and may reduce\r\nthe amount of inoculum in spring, but, because the\r\nfungus winters also on canes in most sections of\r\nthe country, removal of leaves cannot be expected\r\nto provide a disease-free garden the next season.\r\nComparative tests have shown that fall cleanup\r\nis ineffectual. A good mulch, applied after\r\nuncovering and the first feeding in spring, serves\r\nas a mechanical barrier between inoculum from\r\noverwintered leaves on the ground and developing\r\nleaves overhead. A mulch also reduces disease by\r\nreducing the distance spores can be splashed from\r\none bush to another during the season. Drastic\r\nspring pruning, far lower than normal, reduces the\r\namount of inoculum from infected canes.\r\nThe importance of a dormant spray is debatable. Experiments have shown that as a true\r\neradicant, applied in winter, it has little value in\r\nreducing the amount of blackspot the next summer. Use liquid lime sulfur after pruning, provided the buds have not broken far enough to\r\nshow the leaflets.\r\nSummer spraying or dusting, weekly throughout the season (from late April to early November\r\nin New Jersey) is essential if you want to keep\r\nenough foliage on bushes for continuous production of fine flowers (it takes food manufactured in\r\nseveral leaves to produce one bloom) and for\r\nwinter survival. Some strong varieties will, however, live for years without chemical treatment;\r\nthey are usually scraggly bushes with erratic\r\nbloom. The idea that floribunda varieties do not\r\nrequire as much spraying as hybrid teas is\r\na misconception. Some floribundas are quite\r\nresistant; others are very susceptible. The same\r\nholds true for old-fashioned shrub roses. All too\r\noften blackspot gets a head start in a garden from\r\nshrub roses we thought it unnecessary to spray.\r\nRoses can be defoliated as readily by\r\nchemicals as by the blackspot fungus; so the\r\nfungicide chosen must be safe under the conditions of applications as well as effective. There\r\nare many chemicals that will control blackspot if\r\nthey are applied regularly and thoroughly. Choice\r\ndepends somewhat on climate. Some copper\r\nsprays and dusts cause red spotting and defoliation in cool, cloudy weather. Bordeaux mixture is\r\nboth unsightly and harmful, unless used in very\r\nweak dilution. At strengths recommended for\r\nvegetables it will quickly turn rose leaves yellow\r\nand make them drop off. Dusts containing more\r\nthan 3 to 4 % metallic copper are injurious under\r\nsome weather conditions. Dusting sulfur fine\r\nenough to pass through a 325-mesh screen has\r\nbeen successfully used for years for blackspot\r\ncontrol, but in hot weather it burns margins of\r\nleaves. Copper and sulfur have a synergistic\r\neffect; a mixture of the two is more effective\r\nthan either used alone, but such a mixture also\r\ncombines injurious effects.\r\nDiplocarpon 101"

You will have to determine by trial and error the best combination for\r\nyour area, and you may not find one that combines remedies for all the pests you may have to\r\nfight through the season. Choose one that contains ingredients required every week all summer, and then add other chemicals if and when\r\nnecessary.

This may mean\r\nevery 5 or 6 days when plants are growing rapidly\r\nin a rainy spring and perhaps every 7 to 9 days in\r\ndry weather, when growth is slow. Intervals of\r\n10 to 14 days between sprays seldom give\r\nadequate control. Most directions call for application ahead of rain so that the foliage will be\r\nprotected when spores germinate during the rain;\r\nbut if sprays are applied every 7 days, there will\r\nalways be enough residue left on the foliage to\r\ngive protection during the next rain.

In general, the chief\r\ncharacteristic of a blight is sudden and conspicuous leaf and fruit damage, in contradistinction to\r\nleaf spotting, where dead areas are definitely\r\ndelimited, or to wilt due to a toxin or other disturbance in the vascular system. Fire blight,\r\ndiscussed under Bacterial Diseases, is a typical\r\nblight, with twigs and branches dying back but\r\nholding withered, dead foliage.\r\nAlternaria\r\nDeuteromycetes, Hyphomycetes\r\nDark, muriform conidia formed in chains, simple\r\nor branches, or sometimes singly, on dark, simple\r\nconidiophores growing from dark hyphae (see\r\nFig. 1). The apical portion of each conidium is\r\nnarrowed and often elongated, bearing at its tip\r\nthe next ovoid, tapering conidium. Species with\r\nthis characteristic formerly placed in\r\nMacrosporium are now in Alternaria; those with\r\nspores rounded at both ends have been transferred\r\nto Stemphylium.\r\nThere are many saprophytic species in\r\nAlternaria, the spores of which are wind-borne\r\nfor many miles and are a common cause of\r\nhayfever. There are also parasitic forms causing\r\nblights and leaf spots. Sometimes the disease\r\nstarts as a leaf spot, but the lesions, typically\r\nformed in concentric circles, run together to\r\nform a blight, the dark conidia making the surface\r\nappear dark and velvety.\r\nAlternaria alternata Blight, Foliage and Pod\r\nof pea.\r\nAlternaria cassiae Seedling Blight of Cassia\r\n(sicklepod, and coffee senna), and showy\r\ncrotalaria.\r\nAlternaria cucumerina Alternaria Blight of\r\nCucurbits, Cucumber Blight, Black Mold, general on cucumbers, muskmelon, watermelon, and\r\nwinter and summer squash.

Leaves curl and dry up, cantaloupe foliage being more sensitive than that of\r\nother cucurbits. The disease spreads rapidly in\r\nwarm, humid weather, and, with the vines drying,\r\nthe fruit is exposed to sunburn.

This is\r\nthe result of many spot infections and not from an\r\ninvasion of the vascular system.\r\nBuds rot or open to distorted flowers with\r\nirregular brown flecks. There are sometimes\r\nsevere stem lesions, but the rot rarely progresses\r\ninto the bulbs. Spores formed in the usual graymold masses in blighted portions are spread by\r\nrain, air currents, and gardeners. Optimum spore\r\ngermination is in cool weather, around 60 \u0001F, but\r\nonce infection has started 70 \u0001F promotes most\r\nrapid blighting. With sufficient moisture the\r\ncycle may repeat every few days through the\r\nseason. The fungus winters as very small black\r\nsclerotia, irregular or elliptical in shape, in fallen\r\nflowers or blighted dead stems and leaves, or as\r\nmycelium in the basal rosette of Madonna lilies.\r\nControl Avoid too dense planting, and shady or\r\nlow spots with little air circulation and subject to\r\nheavy dews. Clean up infected plant parts before\r\nsclerotia can be formed. Copper sprays are more\r\neffective for the lily Botrytis than the newer\r\norganics. Spray with bordeaux mixture; start\r\nwhen lilies are 5 or 6 inches high and continue\r\nat 10-to 14-day intervals until flowering.\r\nBotrytis galanthina Botrytis Blight of snowdrop, sometimes found in the sclerotial state on\r\nimported bulbs.

In northern\r\nareas the disease is a corm-rotting problem, in\r\nthe South a flower blight, damaging in transit, and\r\nin all areas it is a leaf spot or blight.\r\nIn dry weather and in more resistant varieties\r\nthe leaf spots are very small, rusty brown,\r\nappearing only on the exposed side of the leaf.\r\nIn more humid weather the spots are large,\r\nbrown, round to oval or smaller, pale brown\r\nwith reddish margins. Flower stems have pale\r\nbrown spots that turn dark. There may be a soft\r\nrotting at the base of florets. The disease starts on\r\npetals as pinpoint, water-soaked spots, but in\r\nmoist weather the whole flower turns brown and\r\nslimy. Flowers with no visible spotting when\r\npacked often arrive ruined. After the flowers are\r\ncut, infection spreads down the stalk and into the\r\ncorm, producing dark brown spots, irregular in\r\nshape and size, most numerous on the upper surface. Corms may become soft and spongy with\r\na whitish mold. Oval, flat, black sclerotia, 1/8 to\r\n1/4 inch long, are formed on corms in storage and\r\nin rotting tissue in the field or in refuse piles. They\r\nmay persist in the soil several years.\r\nControl Cure corms rapidly after digging; bury\r\nor burn all plant refuse.\r\nBotrytis hyacinthi Hyacinth Botrytis Blight\r\nrecently found in Washington on plants grown\r\nfrom imported bulbs. Leaves have brown tips\r\nwith gray mold or brown spots on lower surface.\r\nLeaves may be killed, with small black sclerotia\r\nformed in rotting tissue. Flowers rot and are covered with powdery gray spores. Do not work with\r\nplants when they are wet; remove infected parts\r\nor whole plants.\r\nBotrytis narcissicola \u25b6Sclerotinia\r\nnarcissicola, under Rots.\r\nBotrytis paeoniae Peony Botrytis Blight, Early\r\nBlight, Bud Blast, Gray Mold, probably present\r\nwherever peonies are grown. It is also recorded\r\non lily-of-the-valley, but that may be a form of\r\nBotrytis cinerea. Peony blight was first noticed in\r\nepiphytotic form in this country in 1897 and has\r\nbeen important in wet springs ever since.\r\nYoung shoots may rot off at the base as they\r\ncome through the ground or when a few inches\r\nhigh, with a dense velvety gray mold on the\r\nrotting portions. This early shoot blight is far\r\nmore common when the young stems are kept\r\nmoist by having to emerge through a mulch of\r\nmanure or wet leaves. Flowers are attacked at any\r\nstage. Buds turn black when they are very tiny,\r\nnever developing, or they may be blasted when\r\nthey are half open. If it is dry in early spring,\r\ninfection may be delayed until flowers are in\r\nfull bloom, at which time they turn brown. Infection proceeds from the flower down the stem for\r\na few inches, giving it a brown and tan zoned\r\nappearance. Leaf spots develop when infected\r\npetals fall on foliage.

Secondary infection is abundant\r\nin cool moist weather. In late summer small, shiny\r\nblack, slightly loaf-shaped sclerotia are formed near\r\nthe base of stalks, just under the epidermis. They are\r\nquite different from the large, flat, black sclerotia\r\noften formed by B. cinerea on the same stalks.\r\nControl Sanitation is the most important step.\r\nCut down all tops in autumn at ground level, or\r\njust below, to get rid of sclerotia wintering near\r\nbase of stems. Burn this debris; never use it for\r\na mulch. Avoid any moisture-retentive covering.\r\nIf you insist on manure, apply it in a wide ring\r\naround the plant, well outside the area of emerging shoots. Go around with a paper bag periodically, cutting off for burning all blighted parts;\r\nnever carry these parts loose through the garden\r\nfor fear of shedding spores to healthy plants.\r\nBotrytis polyblastis \u25b6Sclerotinia polyblastis.\r\nBotrytis streptothrix (see \u25b6Streptobotrys\r\narisaemae) (teleomorph state Streptotinia\r\narisaemae). Leaf and Stalk Blight of Jack-inthe-pulpit and golden club.\r\nBotrytis tulipae Tulip Fire, Botrytis Blight of\r\ntulips, general wherever tulips are grown, causing\r\nmuch damage in rainy springs. The first indication of disease is the appearance of a few malformed leaves and shoots among healthy tulips or\r\nlarge light patches resembling frost injury on\r\nleaves. Gray mold forming on such blighted\r\nareas of plants grown from infected bulbs provides an enormous number of conidia to be\r\nsplashed by rain to nearby tulips. Secondary\r\ninfection appears as minute, slightly sunken, yellowish leaf spots, surrounded with a watersoaked area, and gray to brown spots on stems,\r\noften zonate, and resulting in collapse. Small\r\nwhite spots appear on colored flowers, brown\r\nspots on white petals (see Fig. 3); but with continued moisture the spots grow together, and in\r\na day or so the fuzzy gray mold has covered rotten\r\nblooms and large portions of blighted leaves.\r\nVery small, shiny black sclerotia are formed in\r\nleaves and petals rotting into the ground, or on old\r\nflower stems or bulbs. Sometimes the latter have\r\nyellow to brown, slightly sunken, circular lesions\r\non outermost fleshy scales without the formation\r\nof sclerotia. Spring infection comes from spores\r\nproduced on such bulbs or from sclerotia on bulbs\r\nor sclerotia left loose in the soil after infected\r\ntissues have rotted.\r\nControl Inspect all bulbs carefully before planting; discard those harboring sclerotia or suspicious brown lesions. It is wise, though seldom\r\npossible in a small garden, to plant new bulbs\r\nwhere tulips have not grown for 3 years. Plant\r\nwhere there is good air circulation. Make periodic\r\ninspections, starting early, removing into a paper\r\nbag plants with serious primary infection and\r\nblighted leaves. Cut off all fading flowers before\r\npetals fall; cut off all foliage at ground level when\r\nit turns yellow.

It was particularly serious on Massachusetts azaleas in 1931\r\nand 1939. Flower buds are dwarfed, turn brown\r\nand dry; scales are silvery gray. Twigs die when\r\nlateral leaf buds are infected. Successive crops of\r\ncoremia are produced on old dead buds for as\r\nlong as three years, the first crop appearing the\r\nspring after summer infection.

The teleomorph state, when\r\nknown, is Mycosphaerella.\r\nCercospora apii Early Blight of celery, general\r\non celery and celeriac, first noted in Missouri in\r\n1884 and since found in varying abundance wherever celery is grown. The disease is most severe\r\nfrom New Jersey southward. The name is somewhat misleading; in Florida early blight rarely\r\nappears before the Septoria disease known as\r\nlate blight. Foliage spots appear when plants are\r\nabout 6 weeks old. Minute yellow areas change to\r\nlarge, irregular, ash gray lesions, covered in moist\r\nweather with velvety groups of conidiophores\r\nand spores on both sides of leaves. Sunken, tan,\r\nelongated spots appear on stalks just before harvest. The disease spreads rapidly in warm, moist\r\nweather, the spores being splashed by rain, carried with manure or cultivators, or blown by\r\nwind. The life cycle is completed in 2 weeks.\r\nControl Seed more than 2 years old is probably\r\nfree from viable spores; other seed should be\r\ntreated with hot water, 30 min at 118\u0001 to 120 \u0001F.\r\nCercospora 111"

Suddenly, in 1947, a blight\r\nshowed up in Florida as a serious threat to the\r\ngladiolus cut-flower industry, ruining hundreds\r\nof acres there and in Alabama in the next few\r\nmonths. The disease is now recorded as far north\r\nas New York and Wisconsin and on the Pacific\r\nCoast. The pathogen is usually identified as\r\nCurvularia lunata, known as a crop pest for\r\nmany years, especially in the tropics, but studies\r\nindicate it is a special form of C. trifolii, cause of\r\na leaf spot of clover.\r\nCurvularia spots on leaf or stem are oval, tan\r\nto dark brown, showing on both sides of the leaf,\r\nbordered with a brown ring, slightly depressed\r\nand with a narrow yellowish region between the\r\nspot and normal green of the leaf. Tan centers of\r\nspots are covered with black spores resembling\r\npowder. Premature death comes when stems of\r\nyoung plants are girdled; florets fail to open when\r\npetioles are girdled.\r\nUnder favorable weather conditions tan spots\r\non petals turn into a smudgy flower blight.\r\nBrown to black irregular lesions appear on\r\ncorms of blooming stock and develop further in\r\nstorage; the fungus survives in corms from one\r\nseason to the next. This is a high temperature\r\nfungus, with optimum for growth 75\u0001 to 85 \u0001F\r\nand no infection under 55 \u0001F. A 13-h dew period\r\nis sufficient moisture. Leaf spots show up in 4 to\r\n5 days, spots on florets and stems in only 2 to\r\n3 days. The complete life cycle is as short as\r\na week in warm rainy weather, and the\r\nfungus can survive in the soil for 3 years.\r\nMany gladiolus varieties are more or less\r\nresistant; Picardy and some others are very\r\nsusceptible.\r\nCylindrocladium\r\nDeuteromycetes, Hyphomycetes\r\nConidiophores dichotomously branched; spores\r\nhyaline, two-or several-celled.\r\nCylindrocladium clavatum Blight on bird-ofparadise.\r\nCylindrocladium scoparium Cylindrocladium\r\nBlight.

The disease is most severe along the coast; optimum\r\ntemperature is around 80 \u0001F. The fungus is seedborne, but most lima bean seed is produced where\r\nthe disease does not occur. Use healthy seed;\r\nclean up refuse; rotate crops.\r\nDiaporthe phaseolorum var. sojae Soybean\r\nPod and Stem Blight, widespread. This disease\r\nwas formerly confused with the more acute stem\r\ncanker caused by D. phaseolorum var. caulivora\r\n(\u25b6 Rots).

Southern Corn Leaf Blight, easily confused with southern corn leaf spot due to\r\nH. carbonum. The leaf blight occurs throughout\r\nthe corn areas of the South and north to Illinois,\r\nmore important on field than on sweet corn.

Small, elliptical, dark grayish green, water-soaked spots turn\r\ngreenish tan and enlarge to spindle-shape, 1/2 to 2\r\ninches wide, 2 to 6 inches long. Spores developing\r\non both leaf surfaces after rain or heavy dew give\r\na velvety dark green appearance to the center of\r\nthe lesions. Whole leaves may be killed; entire\r\nfields turn dry.

Starting as a sudden\r\noutbreak near Charleston, South Carolina, 1931,\r\nthe disease spread rapidly north of Wilmington,\r\nNorth Carolina, down the coast to Florida, and\r\naround the Gulf. It reached Texas by 1938 and\r\nwas in California by 1940; it was reported in\r\nMaryland in 1945, in Virginia in 1947, and in\r\nPhiladelphia in 1959. Petal blight was reported\r\nfrom a Long Island, New York, greenhouse in\r\n1956, apparently present there since 1952, and in\r\n1959 infected all the azaleas in one New Jersey\r\ngreenhouse. In both cases the blight started on\r\nplants purchased from the South. This is the most\r\nspectacular disease that I have ever witnessed,\r\nwith most of the bloom on all the azaleas in\r\na town blighting simultaneously and seemingly\r\novernight under special weather conditions.

Spores shot\r\ninto the air are carried by wind drift to flowers\r\nnear the ground of early varieties, initial spots\r\nbeing whitish. If you put your finger on such\r\na spot, the tissue melts away. With continued\r\nhigh humidity, heavy fog, dew, or rain, conidia\r\nare produced over the inner surfaces of petals and\r\nare widely disseminated to other petals by wind,\r\ninsects, and splashed rain. Within a few hours\r\ncolored petals are peppered with small white\r\nspots, and white flowers have numerous brown\r\nspots.

Infected blooms\r\nseldom drop normally but remain hanging on\r\nthe bushes in an unsightly condition for weeks\r\nand months, some even to the next season. Many\r\nof the sclerotia, however, drop out and remain in\r\nthe litter on the ground ready to send up apothecia\r\nthe next winter.\r\nBoth Indian and Kurume varieties are\r\nattacked, the peak of infection coming with\r\nmid-season varieties such as Pride of Mobile or\r\nFormosa. In some seasons dry weather during\r\nearly spring allows a good showing of azaleas;\r\nin other years blight starts early and there is little\r\ncolor unless azaleas are sprayed. On Belgian azaleas in greenhouses blight may start in December.\r\nControl Some mulches and soil treatments will\r\ninhibit apothecial production. Secondary infection is bound to come from some untreated azalea\r\nin the neighborhood. Spraying gives very effective, even spectacular, control if started on time,\r\nwhen early varieties are in bloom and midseason\r\nazaleas are showing color. Sprays must be\r\nrepeated three times a week as long as petal\r\nsurface is expanding, about 3 or 4 weeks. After\r\nthat, weekly spraying is sufficient. Spraying is\r\nmandatory now for the big azalea gardens, and\r\nthe admission fees from the lengthened season\r\npay for the program many times over.\r\nThe original successful formula was: Dithane\r\nD-14 (nabam) 1 1/3 quarts to 100 gallons water,\r\nplus 1 pound 25 % zinc sulfate, 1/2 pound\r\nhydrated lime, and 1 ounce of spreader Triton\r\nB 1956. Later work showed that the lime could\r\nbe omitted, Dithane reduced to 1 quart, and zinc\r\nsulfate to 2/3 pound to prevent injury in periods of\r\ndrought. The spray should be a fine mist, applied\r\nfrom several directions to get adequate coverage.\r\nCommercial growers should beware of ordering azaleas from the South unless they are barerooted and all flower buds showing color\r\nremoved. As a matter of fact, any potted or balled\r\nand burlapped plant grown in a nursery near\r\nazaleas could very easily bring along some of\r\nthe tiny sclerotia in the soil, and they might\r\nremain viable more than 1 year.

The connection with Pellicularia is recent,\r\nand the name does not have universal agreement.\r\nOne strain of the fungus has been called Sclerotium delphinii in the North, where the disease is\r\nusually designated crown rot. This is, however,\r\na variable fungus with single spore cultures from\r\nthe Pellicularia stage producing sclerotia typical\r\nof Sclerotium delphinii and of S. rolfsii, with intermediate forms. Sclerotia of the southern blight\r\nstrain are very small, round, tan, about the size,\r\nshape, and color of mustard seed, the pathogen\r\nbeing frequently called the mustard-seed fungus.\r\nSouthern blight affects almost all plants\r\nexcept field crops like wheat, oats, corn, and\r\nsorghum.

The sclerotia formed in the wefts are\r\nfirst white, later reddish tan or light brown. They\r\nmay be numerous enough to form a crust over the\r\nsoil for several inches around a stem, or they may\r\nbe somewhat sparse and scattered.\r\nIn the white stage, droplets of liquid often\r\nform on the sclerotia, and the oxalic acid in this\r\nliquid is assumed to kill plant cells in advance of\r\nthe fungus hyphae. This means that the pathogen\r\nnever has to penetrate living tissue and explains\r\nwhy so many different kinds of plants succumb so\r\nreadily to southern blight. Fruits touching the\r\nground, as well as vegetables with fleshy roots,\r\nlike carrots and beets, or plants with bulbs or\r\nrhizomes, like onions, narcissus, and iris, seem\r\nparticularly subject to this disease. Low ornamentals such as ajuga blight quickly, the whole\r\nplant turning black; tall plants like delphinium rot\r\nat the crown and then die back or topple over;\r\nbulbs have a cheesy interior, with sclerotia\r\nforming on or between the scales.\r\nControl Remove diseased plants as soon as they\r\nare noticed. Take out surrounding soil, for 6\r\ninches beyond the diseased area, wrapping it\r\ncarefully so that none of the sclerotia drop back.\r\nIncreasing the organic content of the soil reduces\r\nsouthern blight, as does the addition of nitrogenous fertilizers, such as ammonium nitrate.\r\nTreating narcissus bulbs in hot water for 3 h, as\r\nfor nematodes, kills the fungus in all except the\r\nvery largest bulbs.\r\nPellicularia filamentosa (see \u25b6Thanatephorus\r\ncucumeris), teleomorph state of Rhizoctonia\r\nsolani.

They enlarge to an inch or more, become\r\ntan with a darker border, are sometimes zonate.\r\nThe whitish mycelium grows rapidly over the leaf\r\nblade, killing it, and spreads a web from leaf to\r\nleaf, over petioles, flowers, and fruit, in wet\r\nweather and at temperatures 70\u0001 to 90 \u0001F; in dry\r\nweather growth is inconspicuous except on fallen\r\nleaves. The fungus is spread by wind, rain, irrigation water, cultivating tools, and bean pickers;\r\nit survives in sclerotial form from season to\r\nseason.\r\nControl Destroy infected plants; clean up refuse.\r\nIn Florida, do not plant beans between June and\r\nSeptember if web blight has been present.

The disease has been known, in its\r\nsclerotium stage, for many years on hundreds of\r\nplants. The connection with Pellicularia is\r\nrecent, and the name does not have universal\r\nagreement. One strain of the fungus has been\r\ncalled Sclerotium delphinii in the North, where\r\nthe disease is usually designated crown rot. This\r\nis, however, a variable fungus with single spore\r\ncultures from the Pellicularia stage producing\r\nsclerotia typical of Sclerotium delphinii and of\r\nS. rolfsii, with intermediate forms. Sclerotia of\r\nthe southern blight strain are very small, round,\r\ntan, about the size, shape, and color of mustard\r\nseed, the pathogen being frequently called the\r\nmustard-seed fungus.\r\nSouthern blight affects almost all plants\r\nexcept field crops like wheat, oats, corn, and\r\nsorghum. Fruits and vegetables include Jerusalem artichoke, avocado, bean, beet, carrot, cabbage, cucumber, eggplant, endive, lettuce, melon,\r\nokra, onion, garlic and shallot, pea, peanut, pepper, potato, rhubarb, strawberry, sweet potato,\r\ntomato, turnip, and watermelon.

The sclerotia formed in the wefts are\r\nfirst white, later reddish tan or light brown. They\r\nmay be numerous enough to form a crust over the\r\nsoil for several inches around a stem, or they may\r\nbe somewhat sparse and scattered.\r\nIn the white stage, droplets of liquid often\r\nform on the sclerotia, and the oxalic acid in this\r\nliquid is assumed to kill plant cells in advance of\r\nthe fungus hyphae. This means that the pathogen\r\nnever has to penetrate living tissue and explains\r\nwhy so many different kinds of plants succumb so\r\nreadily to southern blight. Fruits touching the\r\nground, as well as vegetables with fleshy roots,\r\nlike carrots and beets, or plants with bulbs or\r\nrhizomes, like onions, narcissus, and iris, seem\r\nparticularly subject to this disease. Low ornamentals such as ajuga blight quickly, the whole\r\nplant turning black; tall plants like delphinium rot\r\nat the crown and then die back or topple over;\r\nbulbs have a cheesy interior, with sclerotia\r\nforming on or between the scales.\r\nControl Remove diseased plants as soon as they\r\nare noticed. Take out surrounding soil, for\r\n6 inches beyond the diseased area, wrapping it\r\ncarefully so that none of the sclerotia drop back.\r\nIncreasing the organic content of the soil reduces\r\nsouthern blight, as does the addition of nitrogenous fertilizers, such as ammonium nitrate.\r\nTreating narcissus bulbs in hot water for 3 h, as\r\nfor nematodes, kills the fungus in all except the\r\nvery largest bulbs.\r\nPellicularia koleroga (Corticium stevensii).\r\nThread Blight, a southern disease, from North\r\nCarolina to Texas, important on fig and tung,\r\nsometimes defoliating pittosporum, crape myrtle,\r\nroses, and other ornamentals, and some fruits.\r\nThe disease is recorded on apple, azalea, banana\r\nshrub, blackberry, boxwood, camphor, cherry\r\nlaurel, chinaberry, columbine, crabapple, crape\r\nmyrtle, casuarina, currant, dewberry, dogwood,\r\nelderberry, elm, erythrina, euonymus, fig,\r\nflowering almond, flowering quince, goldenrod,\r\ngooseberry, guava, honeysuckle, hibiscus, morning glory, pear, pecan, pepper vine, persimmon,\r\npittosporum, plum, pomegranate, quince, rose,\r\nsatsuma orange, soapberry, silver maple, sweet\r\npotato, tievine (Jacquemontia), tung, Virginia\r\ncreeper, and viburnum.\r\nThe fungus winters as sclerotia on twigs and\r\nleaf petioles, and in May and June produces\r\nthreadlike mycelium that grows over lower surface of leaves, killing them and causing premature defoliation, although often dead leaves hang\r\non the tree in groups, matted together by threadlike spider webs. Fruiting patches on leaves are\r\nfirst white, then buff. The fungus flourishes in\r\nmoist weather, temperatures 75\u0001 to 90 \u0001F.\r\nControl On figs, one or two applications of tribasic copper sulfate, or bordeaux mixture, are\r\nsatisfactory until the fruit ripens in July.

For 200 years potatoes\r\nthrived in Europe as the main source of carbohydrate food, but in August 1845, the Gardener\u2019s\r\nChronicle reported: \u201cA fatal malady has broken\r\nout amongst the potato crop. On all sides we hear\r\nof destruction. In Belgium the fields are said to\r\nhave been completely desolated. There is hardly\r\na sound sample in Covent Garden Market.\u201dThe\r\neditor went on to describe the decay and to say:\r\n\u201cAs to cure for this distemper there is none. One\r\nof our correspondents is today angry with us for\r\nnot telling the public how to stop it; but he ought\r\nto consider that Man has no power to arrest the\r\ndispensations of Providence. We are visited by\r\na great calamity which we must bear.\u201d And in\r\n1946 American gardeners were again blaming the\r\neditor, for lack of information on tomato blight.\r\nIn 1845 the weather was continued gloom and\r\nfog, with below-average temperatures. The Gardener\u2019s Chronicle editor was sure blight was due\r\nto potatoes being overladen with water. The Rev.\r\nM. J. Berkeley disagreed. He insisted blight was\r\ndue to a fungus, with the weather contributing to\r\nspread of a moisture-loving parasite. The argument raged, for this was long before Pasteur and\r\nhis germ theory, and the first time anyone\r\nbelieved a fungus could be the cause and not the\r\nconsequence of plant disease. A French scientist,\r\nMontagne, named the fungus Botrytis infestans,\r\nbut the first really good description of it was\r\npublished by Berkeley, and it remained for the\r\nGerman de Bary, in 1876, actually to prove\r\nthe pathogenic nature of the fungus and to\r\nerect the new genus Phytophthora to include it.\r\nMeanwhile the disease was making history.\r\nThe loss of the potato crop in 1845 and 1846\r\nkilled off a million people and caused another\r\nmillion and a half to emigrate; the first Government Relief program was instigated; and the\r\nEnglish Corn Laws were repealed with a change\r\nto a policy of free trade and unbounded expansion\r\nof commerce.\r\nLate Blight of Potato\r\nSymptoms After blossoming, large, dark green,\r\nwater-soaked spots appear on leaves in wet\r\nweather, first on lower leaves. As a spot enlarges\r\nthe center is shriveled, dry, dark brown to black,\r\nand a downy, whitish growth appears on the\r\nunderside of leaves. Similar lesions are formed\r\non stems and petioles, and there is a characteristic\r\nstrong odor as tops are blighted. On tubers, first\r\nsymptoms are small brown to purple discolorations of skin on upper side, changing to\r\ndepressed pits when tubers are removed from\r\nsoil and put in storage (see Fig. 4). On cutting\r\nthrough the potato, a reddish brown dry rot is\r\nseen.\r\nLife History The primary cycle starts with\r\ninfected tubers, which have harbored mycelium\r\nin the dry rot patches over winter. If infected seed\r\npieces are planted, the fungus grows systemically\r\ninto the shoots and finally fruits by sending sporangiophores out through the stomata on lower\r\nleaf surfaces (see Fig. 5). These swell at the tips\r\ninto ovoid bodies, sporangia, then branch and\r\nproduce successively more sporangia. The latter\r\nmay function as conidia, putting out a germ tube,\r\nbut more often are differentiated into a number of\r\nswarmspores (zoospores), which have cilia\r\nenabling them to swim about after they are\r\nsplashed by rain to another leaf. Eventually they\r\nstop swimming and send a germ tube in through\r\nthe leaf cuticle or enter through a stoma. Initial\r\ninfection in the field also comes from conidia\r\nblown over from sprouts produced on infected\r\ntubers in cull piles. Blighting follows rapidly,\r\nwith first symptoms 5 days or less from the time\r\nof infection and with the fungus fruiting again in\r\na whitish layer on the underside of leaves.\r\nFig. 4 Late Blight on Potato\r\nLate Blight of Potato 133"

They have been\r\nproduced in culture.\r\nWeather Relations This is a disease entirely\r\ndependent on weather conditions. Temperature\r\nand moisture conditions are right for an epiphytotic about 2 years out of 5. Zoospores are produced only in cool weather, 60 \u0001F and under, but\r\nthey invade leaves most rapidly at higher temperatures. Because they are swimming spores, rain is\r\nrequired. A cool, wet July is usually followed by\r\nblight in August and September.\r\nControl Some varieties, such as Kennebec, Essex,\r\nPungo, and Cherokee, are resistant to the common\r\nstrain of the fungus but not to some of the newer\r\nstrains. Treat potato dumps and cull piles with\r\na weed spray to control sprouts. Delay digging crop\r\nuntil 2 weeks after tops die, or else kill the tops with\r\na weed killer to prevent infection at early digging.\r\nLate Blight of Tomato\r\nAlthough there are potato and tomato strains of\r\nPhytophthora infestans, each is capable of\r\ninfecting the other host. Ordinarily blight starts\r\nwith potatoes in midsummer; when the fungus\r\nmoves over to tomatoes, it has to go through\r\nseveral cycles to build up a strain virulent enough\r\nto produce general blighting, and by that time the\r\ntomato season is nearly over. Now we know that\r\nit is possible for the tomato strain to winter in\r\npotato tubers and be ready to inflict damage on\r\ntomatoes with the first crop of zoospores produced on potato sprouts. Conversely, tomato\r\nseedlings brought up from the South and planted\r\nnear potato fields can start an epiphytotic of late\r\nblight on potatoes.\r\nThe 1946 tomato blight saga \u2013 the one that\r\nawakened eastern gardeners to the fact that plant\r\ndisease could be as important to home gardeners\r\nas to farmers \u2013 started in Florida late in November 1945. By January the disease was extremely\r\ndestructive in tomato seedbeds, and it continued\r\nso intermittently whenever temperatures ranged\r\nfrom 60\u0001 to 70 \u0001F and relative humidity was\r\nnearly 100 % for more than 15 h.

No conidia are known; so\r\nthere is no secondary infection from flower to\r\nflower as with azalea blight. The amount of primary inoculum is very large, however. One afternoon in New Orleans I collected nearly 1000\r\nsclerotia that were producing apothecia from\r\nunder a single camellia.\r\nControl The first line of defense is exclusion.\r\nMost southern states have quarantines against\r\nknown infected areas; they require that plants be\r\nshipped bare-rooted, with all flower buds showing color removed. Northern gardeners ordering\r\nplants for greenhouses should insist on the same\r\nprecautions even without specific quarantines.\r\nPractically all outbreaks of camellia flower blight\r\nhave been traced to plants shipped in cans, presumably carrying sclerotia in the soil.

The two species,\r\nsingly or together, produce the disease known as\r\nlate blight, first reported in Delaware in 1891 and\r\nsince causing much crop destruction, one\r\nCalifornia county reporting half a million dollars\r\nloss from celery blight in 1908 and Michigan\r\na million in 1915. It was not known until 1932\r\nthat two distinct species were involved.\r\nEarly symptoms are similar. Large leaf spot,\r\ndue to S. apii, starts as a light yellow area, which\r\nsoon turns brown and dies. Spots are up to 1/4\r\ninch in diameter, with small black pycnidia. In\r\nsmall leaf spot, due to S. apiigraveolentis, the\r\nmore common and destructive pathogen,\r\npycnidia appear at the first sign of chlorotic spotting and are often outside of the indefinite margins of the spots, which are not over 2 mm. If\r\ninfection is severe, the spots fuse, and the leaves\r\nturn brownish black and rot. Leaf stalks may also\r\nbe infected. Pycnidia winter on seed and in plant\r\nrefuse in garden and compost. A single pycnidium of the small-spot fungus has an average of\r\n3675 spores, extruded in gelatinous tendrils.\r\nA single leaf spot may average 56 pycnidia, and\r\na single plant may have 2000 spots.

The disease now extends from New\r\nJersey to North Carolina and Mississippi.\r\nTrees show sparse foliage, smaller leaves, and\r\nelongated sunken cankers on trunks and larger\r\nbranches. Cross sections through cankers reveal\r\nblue black or reddish brown discoloration of\r\nwood, usually in wedge-shaped sectors. First\r\nyear cankers may not be more than 2 inches\r\nwide and a yard or so long, but they widen\r\nannually, girdling and killing trees in 3 to\r\n5 years. Several cankers coalescing around the\r\ntrunk kill more quickly. Once infection starts,\r\nthe tree is doomed.\r\nAscospores and the two types of conidia are\r\nproduced in moist spring weather (see Fig. 1).\r\nThey may be spread by rain a short distance, but\r\nmost dissemination is by man in pruning operations, and ordinary tree paint carry viable spores.\r\nSome beetles may be vectors. Infection is solely\r\nthrough wounds.\r\nControl Do not try to save trees where trunk has\r\nbeen invaded; diseased branches may sometimes\r\nbe removed, cutting at least 3 feet from infected\r\narea. Do not prune unless absolutely necessary\r\nand then only in winter when trees are less susceptible. Use tree wound dressing fortified with\r\na disinfectant.\r\nCeratocystis sp.

The stem may\r\nbe girdled with dieback to that point.\r\nStem cankers are found around insect punctures, thorn pricks, leaf or thorn scars, or abrasions caused by tying, but the majority of cankers\r\nare formed at the cut end of a cane when a stub\r\nhas been left in pruning above a leaf axil or bud.\r\nRoses cut properly close to a bud seldom develop\r\nthis canker. A rose stub usually dies back to the\r\nfirst node, and since this fungus is a weak parasite, it starts most readily in such dead or dying\r\ntissue. When a cut is made close to the node, it is\r\nquickly callused over, and the callus is a good\r\ndefense against wound fungi.\r\nControl Prune out cankered and dying stems as\r\nsoon as noticed. Make all cuts just above a bud or\r\nleaf axil, not only at spring pruning but in cutting\r\nflowers for the house or cutting off dead blooms\r\nduring the season.\r\nConiothyrium rosarum Rose Graft Canker.\r\nThis is a disease of roses under glass, starting at\r\nthe union of stock and scion in the warm moist\r\npropagating frame and continuing in a large\r\namount of dead wood when plants are removed\r\nto the greenhouse bench. Some consider the pathogen a form of C. fuckelii. Having measured\r\nspores of the type specimen, in the Kew Herbarium, I think they are distinct species, but that\r\nsome cases of graft canker are due to the common\r\ncanker fungus.\r\nConiothyrium wernsdorffiae Rose Brand Canker, a rather rare but very serious disease. The\r\npathogen was named in Germany in 1905 and\r\nwas not reported in this country until 1925,\r\nalthough it was subsequently shown to have\r\nbeen collected in Canada in 1912 and in Pennsylvania and Minnesota in 1914 and 1916. In 1926\r\na severe epiphytotic appeared at Ithaca, New\r\nYork, in the Cornell rose garden, infecting about\r\n90 % of the climbers so seriously that the canes\r\nhad to be cut to the ground. Since then it has been\r\nreported from a few other states, but in several\r\ninstances it has been confused with common\r\ncanker.\r\nSmall, dark reddish spots on canes enlarge and\r\nacquire a more or less definite reddish brown or\r\npurple margin, contrasting sharply with the green\r\nof the cane. The center of the spot turns light\r\nbrown as the cells die, and little longitudinal\r\nslits appear over the developing pycnidia. Spores\r\nare olive brown, nearly twice the size of C.\r\nfuckelii, and released through epidermal slits\r\ninstead of being spread in a sooty mass under\r\nthe epidermis. Cankers formed under the winter\r\nprotection of soil are black when roses are first\r\nuncovered in spring, which explains the name\r\nBrandfleckenkrankheit, meaning fire-spot\r\ndisease.\r\nC. wernsdorffiae is a cold temperature fungus,\r\ninfecting rose canes under the winter covering,\r\nentering through insect wounds, thorn scars,\r\nscratches, and occasionally through dormant\r\nbuds. During a 4-year investigation at Ithaca,\r\nI found no infection on canes not hilled with\r\nearth or other moist cover over winter and no\r\nnatural infection during the summer.\r\nControl Omit the usual winter protection of soil\r\nor other materials that keep canes moist. If brand\r\ncanker is a problem, just fasten canes of climbers\r\ndown near the ground, uncovered, and hope for\r\nthe best. Loss from winter injury will be less than\r\nfrom the canker.

Many small spots may be grouped on\r\na single cane. During the winter, and especially\r\non portions of canes covered with earth, cankers\r\nor girdling lesions are formed, often several\r\ninches long, with tan centers and purplish borders. In moist weather the surface of these large\r\ncankers is covered with yellow spore tendrils\r\nfrom pycnidia just under the bark; asci are also\r\nextruded in tendrils from perithecia.\r\nLeaf spots are small purplish specks or larger\r\ndead areas, cinnamon buff to white, bordered\r\nwith purple and with black pycnidia in the center.\r\nMarginal spots are subcircular. Buds are sometimes blighted; exposed petals of flowers have\r\ncinnamon-buff spots without the purple border.\r\nInfection is through wounds and also uninjured\r\ntissue.\r\nControl The best time to take care of brown\r\ncanker is at spring pruning. Cut out every diseased cane possible. A dormant lime sulfur\r\nspray, immediately after pruning, kills spores\r\nthat may have been spread in the process\r\nand may inhibit the fungus in initial lesions.\r\nCopper or sulfur sprays largely prevent\r\nsummer infections.

Bark is discolored in more or less circular\r\nareas; sapwood is reddish brown. In old cankers\r\nexposed wood is surrounded by layers of callus\r\ntissue. In moist weather spring spore tendrils are\r\nextruded from pycnidia in dead bark. Perithecia\r\nare found infrequently in aspen, arranged circularly around a grayish disc; they are flask-shaped\r\nwith long necks pushing through the bark.

It may also appear in stem cankers on\r\nvines and shrubs\u2013ampelopsis, barberry, boxwood, callicarpa, cotoneaster, currant, gooseberry, fig, honeysuckle, kerria, California laurel,\r\nrose, and syringa. The fungus is widespread as\r\na saprophyte. On ornamental trees and shrubs it is\r\nweakly parasitic, producing cankers around\r\nwounds and at base of dead branches or causing\r\na dieback of twigs and branches.\r\nOn maple, the fungus is more pathogenic,\r\nkilling twigs, small branches, young trees, and\r\ngirdling larger branches. It is more frequent on\r\nNorway maple and boxelder; it may also invade\r\nred, sycamore, Japanese, and other maples. First\r\nsymptoms are small, depressed, dead areas in\r\nbark near wounds or branch stubs. Conspicuous\r\nflesh-colored or coral pink sporodochia, formed\r\nin dead bark, bear conidia. Later the pustules turn\r\nchocolate brown and form pockets, in which\r\nperithecia are produced. The canker is most\r\ncommon in severely wounded or recently\r\npruned trees. Sapwood has a greenish discoloration. Open cankers are eventually formed with\r\nsuccessive rolls of callus. Remove diseased wood\r\nand bark, cutting beyond the greenish\r\ndiscoloration.\r\nNectria coccinea var. faginata Nectria Beech\r\nBark Canker on beech in the Northeast. The disease occurs solely in connection with the woolly\r\nbeech scale insects (Cryptococcus fagi and C.\r\nfagisuga), but it has caused high mortality in\r\nCanada, killing 50 % of beech stands; it is epidemic in Maine on American beech and is now\r\npresent in much of New England and New York.\r\nThe scale nymphs, covered with a woolly\r\nwhite down, cluster thickly around cracks and\r\nwounds in bark, often making trunk and branches\r\nappear to be coated with snow. The small yellow\r\nlarvae establish themselves on the bark in\r\nautumn, each inserting its sucking organ, stylet,\r\ninto the living bark, which shrinks and cracks.\r\nNectria enters through these cracks and kills surrounding tissue in bark and cambium. When the\r\ncells are dead, the insects can no longer obtain\r\nfood; therefore, they disappear.\r\nWhite pustules of sporodochia are pushed out\r\nthrough dead bark, bearing elongate, three-to\r\nnine-celled, slightly curved macroconidia. Red\r\nperithecia, slightly lemon-shaped, appear in clusters on the bark, often so abundant that the bark\r\nappears red. After ascospores are discharged, the\r\nupper half of the perithecium collapses and sinks\r\ninto the lower. The eventual canker is a deeply\r\ndepressed cavity surrounded by callus. After the\r\ncambium dies, the leaves wilt; the twigs,\r\nbranches, and roots finally die.\r\nControl Ornamental trees can be sprayed or\r\nscrubbed to kill the insects. A dormant lime sulfur\r\nspray is very effective. Oil sprays will kill the\r\nscale but may injure beech. Late summer\r\nspraying for crawlers can supplement the dormant spray.\r\nNectria desmazierii (Fusarium buxicola,\r\nAnamorph).

Leaves may\r\nshrivel and curl during dry spells (normal leaves\r\noften do likewise). Twigs and large branches die,\r\nfrequently on one side of the tree. The canker\r\ndevelops slowly on the lower trunk near the soil\r\nlevel. Inner bark, cambium and sapwood are\r\ndiscolored; the cankered area is sunken; the\r\nbark dries and falls away, leaving wood exposed.\r\nTrees die when the canker extends completely\r\naround the trunk base or root collar. The fungus\r\nlives in the soil in partially decayed organic matter, and spores are washed to nearby trees.\r\nEntrance is through wounds. The disease affects\r\ntransplanted dogwoods, seldom natives growing\r\nin woods.\r\nControl Transplant carefully, avoiding all unnecessary wounds; avoid hitting base with lawnmower,\r\nby using a wire guard around the tree. It is difficult\r\nto save trees already infected, but cutting out small\r\ncankers and painting the wound with bordeaux\r\npaste is worth trying.

The disease was\r\nimportant in the United States by the middle of\r\nthe nineteenth century, and is now present in at\r\nleast 37 states. Losses come from death of the\r\nplants and also from soil infestation, for susceptible crucifers cannot be grown again on the same\r\nland for several years, unless it is treated. The first\r\nsymptom is wilting of tops on hot days, followed\r\nby partial recovery at night; affected plants may\r\nbe stunted and not dead; outer leaves turn yellow\r\nand drop. The root system becomes a distorted\r\nmass of large and small swellings, sometimes\r\nseveral roots swollen like sweet potatoes, and\r\nsometimes joined in one massive gall. Lateral\r\nand tap roots are scabby and fissured, with rot\r\nstarting from secondary fungi.\r\nWhen diseased roots decompose, small spherical spores are liberated in the soil; they are capable of surviving there many years between crops.\r\nIn spring, with suitable temperature and moisture,\r\nthe resting spores germinate, each becoming\r\na motile swarm spore with a flagellum. This\r\nwhiplike appendage is soon lost, and the organism becomes amoebalike, moving by protoplasmic streaming until it reaches a root hair or other\r\nroot tissue. The plasmodium continues to grow\r\nand divide until it reaches the cambial cells, in\r\nwhich it develops up and down the root. The\r\nswelling is produced by division of plasmodia\r\nand of the infected cells. Eventually the\r\nmultinucleate plasmodium breaks up into many\r\nsmall resting spores, each rounded up around\r\na single nucleus. They are set free by the millions\r\nwhen the root rots, and are spread in soil clinging\r\nto shoes or tools and in drainage water, manure,\r\nand plant refuse. Spores are not seed-borne.\r\nLong-distance spread is probably by infected\r\nseedlings. Infection takes place chiefly in\r\na neutral to acid soil, pH 5.0 to 7.0, at temperatures below 80 \u0001F, and when moisture of soil is\r\nabove 50 % of its water-holding capacity.\r\nControl Inspect seedlings carefully before planting. Dispose of infested crops with caution; resting spores passed through animals are still viable.\r\nR.K.

        "html": "Damping-Off\r\nDamping-off is the destruction of young seedlings by soil organisms. There are two types.\r\nPre-emergence damping-off rots the sprouting\r\nseed before it breaks through the soil; it is recognized by bare spaces in what should be uniform\r\nrows. Such a poor stand may be due to poor\r\nviability of seed, but more often it is due to soil\r\nfungi functioning in cold, wet soils when germination is slow. Post-emergence damping-off is\r\nthe rotting or wilting of seedlings soon after\r\nthey emerge from the soil. Succulent stems have\r\na water-soaked, then necrotic and sunken, zone at\r\nground level; the little herbaceous plants fall over\r\non the ground or, in woody seedlings, wilt and\r\nremain upright. Root decay follows. This type of\r\ndamping-off is most common in greenhouses or\r\noutdoors in warm humid weather and where seedlings are too crowded. Tree seedlings in nursery\r\nrows are subject to this type of damping-off, and\r\nso are perennial flowers started in late summer for\r\nthe next year.\r\nMany fungi living saprophytically in the upper\r\nlayers of soil can cause damping-off. Pythium\r\ndebaryanum, P. mastophorum and Rhizoctonia\r\nsolani are probably most common, but other\r\nspecies of these two genera and Aphanomyces,\r\nBotrytis, Cylindrocladium, Diplodia, Fusarium,\r\nMacrophomina, Helminthosporium, Sclerotium\r\nrolfsii, Fusarium equiseti, and Phytophthora\r\nmay be important on occasion. A synergistic\r\ninteraction of Pythium myriotylum, Fusarium\r\nsolani, and Meloidogyne arenaria causes\r\ndamping-off of peanut which has been reported\r\nin Florida. See under Rots for details.\r\nAlso, Caloscypha fulgens (anamorph state,\r\nGeniculodendron pyriforme) causes damping-off\r\nof spruce seed, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides of\r\npapaya, Colletotrichum acutatum of flowering dogwood and Fusarium moniliforme var. intermedia\r\nof pine.\r\nDamping-off is prevented by starting seed in\r\na sterile medium, such as vermiculite, perlite, or\r\nsphagnum moss, or by treating the soil or the seed\r\nbefore planting. Commercial operators treat soil\r\nwith steam or electricity.\r\nSeed treatment, the coating of seed with\r\na protectant dust, is crop insurance. In some seasons, good stands can be obtained without it, but\r\nit scarcely pays to take a chance. Seed disinfection is used to kill organisms of anthracnose\r\nand other specific diseases carried on seed. The\r\ndamping-off organisms are in the soil, not on the\r\nseed, and coating the seed with a chemical is\r\nintended to kill or inhibit fungi in the soil immediately surrounding the seed and so provide\r\ntemporary protection during germination.\r\nR.K.

        "html": "Dodder\r\nDodders are seed plants parasitic on stems and\r\nother parts of cultivated or wild plants. They are\r\nleafless, orange to yellow twining vines, without\r\nchlorophyll and hence incapable of manufacturing their own food. They are called love vine,\r\nstrangle weed, gold thread, hairweed, devil\u2019s\r\nhair, devil\u2019s ringlet, pull down, clover silk, and\r\nhell-bind, the last being most appropriate. There\r\nare about 40 species in the United States, causing\r\nserious agricultural losses in clovers, alfalfa, and\r\nflax, and becoming more and more important in\r\ngardens on ornamentals and sometimes vegetables. Dodders belong to the single genus Cuscuta,\r\nfamily Cuscutaceae, close to the morning-glory\r\nfamily.\r\nDodder seed is grayish to reddish brown,\r\nresembling small legume seed but roughened\r\nwith three flattened sides. It germinates as ordinary seed but is synchronized to start a little later\r\nthan its host seedlings. The parasite is a slender,\r\nyellowish, unbranched thread with the growing\r\ntip circling around in search of support. When it\r\ntouches the host it twines like a morning-glory\r\nand puts out little suckers, haustoria, into the\r\nstem of the victim, after which its original\r\nconnection with the soil dries up (see Fig. 1).\r\nAlthough seedlings can live for a few weeks\r\nwithout a susceptible host, they finally die if\r\na connection is not established. Successful parasites continue to twine and to spread orange tendrils from one plant to the next, often making\r\na tangle of matted orange hairs many feet across,\r\nwith a black region in the center where plants\r\nhave died. Such tangles are conspicuous in\r\nweeds along roadsides.\r\nIn ornamental plantings host plants are not\r\noften killed but exhibit stunting and pallor, symptoms of starvation. Minute scales or rudimentary\r\nleaves form on the dodder tendrils followed by\r\ndense clusters of beautiful white blossoms (sometimes pale pink or yellow), which ripen seed in\r\nlate summer, with as many as 3000 seed being\r\nproduced on a single plant.\r\nCuscuta spp. Much of the dodder infesting\r\nornamentals is not readily identified as to species, but it is widespread on a great many shrubs,\r\nperennials and annuals. It is found very commonly on chrysanthemum, also strangling any\r\nother plant in the vicinity. Many hours may be\r\nspent cleaning up ivy and trumpet-vine, petunias\r\nand asters. Dodder is reported on camellias in\r\nthe South. It is even a pest of house plants, if\r\nfield soil has been used for the potting mixture.\r\nDodder has, however, one virtue for plant\r\npathologists. It is used as a bridge between\r\nplants to carry viruses and MLOs in testing\r\ntheir host range.\r\nCuscuta americana on citrus C. californica\r\non beet.\r\nCuscuta coryli Hazel Dodder.

        "html": "Plasmopara viburni Viburnum Downy Mildew.\r\nPlasmopara viticola Grape Downy Mildew,\r\ngeneral on grape, also on Virginia Creeper and\r\nBoston ivy. This is a native disease, endemic in\r\neastern United States, first observed in 1834 on\r\nwild grapes. It appeared in France after 1870,\r\nimported with American stock resistant to the\r\nPhylloxera aphid, and in a few years had become\r\nas ruinous to the wine industry of Europe as the\r\npotato blight had been to Ireland. The efficacy of\r\nbordeaux was first discovered in connection with\r\nthis mildew.\r\nIn this country downy mildew is most destructive on European varieties of grape. Pale yellow\r\nspots, varying in form but often nearly circular\r\nand somewhat transparent, appear on upper leaf\r\nsurfaces, and a conspicuous white coating\r\nappears on lower surfaces. The spots turn brown\r\nwith age; in dry weather the downy growth is\r\nscanty. Young canes, leafstocks, and tendrils\r\nmay be infected; flowers may blight or rot;\r\nyoung fruits stop growing, turn dark, and dry\r\nwith a copious grayish growth. Older fruits have\r\na brown rot but lack the mildew effect. Fruits\r\nfrom diseased vines have less juice; bunches are\r\nvery poorly filled.\r\nInitial infection comes from a swarm spore\r\nstopping on the lower side of a leaf, putting out\r\na germ tube and entering through a stoma. In 5 to\r\n20 days the mycelium has spread through the leaf\r\nbetween cells, obtaining food through thinwalled, globular haustoria. The hyphae mass in\r\ncompact cushions just beneath the stomata; under\r\nhumid conditions a few grow out through the\r\nopenings and develop into branched conidiophores (sporangiophores). Each has three to six\r\nmain branches, and they branch again. The terminal branches end in two to four short, slender\r\nsterigmata, each of which produces a single\r\nmultinucleate spore. With moisture, each nucleus\r\nwith adjacent protoplasm is organized into\r\na swarm spore, motile with two cilia. They\r\nswim around for a while, then settle down, absorb\r\ntheir cilia, and put out a germ tube. If they happen\r\nto be on the upper side of a leaf, nothing happens;\r\nif on the lower surface, the germ tube may reach\r\na stoma and start an infection.\r\nToward the end of the growing season thickwalled resting spores, oospores, are produced in\r\nintercellular spaces of the infected leaves. These\r\nare set free in spring by disintegration of host tissue,\r\nare rain-splashed to other vines, and germinate by\r\nproduction of a short, unbranched hypha bearing\r\na single large sporangium, to start the cycle anew.\r\nControl Copper sprays are effective. Apply bordeaux mixture immediately before and just after\r\nblooming; repeat 7 to 10 days later and possibly\r\nwhen fruit is half grown. Destroy fallen leaves by\r\nburning.\r\nPseudoperonospora\r\nOomycetes, Peronosporales\r\nLike Plasmopara but with branches of sporangiophores forming more or less acute angles; tips\r\nmore acute.\r\nPseudoperonospora celtidis Downy Mildew of\r\nhackberry.\r\nPseudoperonospora cubensis Downy Mildew\r\nof cucurbits, destructive to cucumber, muskmelon, and watermelon, particularly along the\r\nAtlantic seaboard and the Gulf Coast, occasional\r\non gourd, pumpkin, and squash. The disease was\r\nfirst noted in 1889 in New Jersey, and in 1896\r\ndestroyed most of the cucumbers on Long Island.\r\nIrregular yellow spots appear on upper leaf surfaces, often on leaves nearest the center of the\r\nhill. The lesion is brown on the opposite side,\r\ncovered with a purple growth in rain or dew.\r\nThe whole leaf may wither and die, with the\r\nfruit dwarfed to nubbins and of poor flavor. The\r\nfungus does not live in the soil and is not prevalent in the North until July or August. It winters in\r\ngreenhouses or comes up from the South by\r\ndegrees. Sporangia are spread by wind and\r\ncucumber beetles. The disease is favored by\r\nhigh humidity, but temperatures need not be as\r\ncool as for other downy mildews.\r\nControl Resistant cucumbers are of rather poor\r\nquality. Cantaloupe varieties Texas Resistant\r\nNo. 1 and Georgia 47 combine resistance to\r\naphids with resistance to downy mildew.\r\nPseudoperonospora 185"

A strict quarantine was placed on\r\ninfested districts, and there has been no spread\r\nto commercial potato fields. The disease shows as\r\nprominent outgrowths or warts originating in the\r\neyes, varying from the size of a pea to that of the\r\ntuber itself. Numerous yellow sporangia are\r\nreleased into the soil by decay of the malformed\r\ntissue. The disease, which may affect other species of Solanum, is spread by contaminated soil or\r\ninfected tubers. Buds and adventitious shoots of\r\ntomato are infected below the soil line.\r\nControl By 1953 potato wart had been eradicated from more than half of the 1,112 infested\r\ngardens in Pennsylvania. The plan called for\r\napplying copper sulfate the first year, keeping\r\nthe land clean and cultivated, applying lime the\r\nnext year, growing vegetables the third year, and\r\ngoing back to potatoes the fourth year to test\r\nresults.\r\nSynchytrium vaccinii Red Leaf Gall on cranberry, azalea, chamaedaphne, gaultheria, and\r\nledum, from New Jersey northward. On cranberry the disease appears just before blossoms\r\nopen. Buds, flowers and young leaves are covered\r\nwith small, red, somewhat globular galls about\r\nthe size of birdshot; affected shoots bear no fruit.\r\nThe disease is erratic in appearance but is most\r\nfrequent in bogs that have excessive or uneven\r\nwater supply.\r\nSynchytrium sp Stem Gall on castor bean, in\r\nTexas. Small red galls on stems, petioles, and\r\nleaves of seedlings.\r\nSynchytrium 193"

        "html": "Leaf Spots\r\nLeaf spots are the most prevalent of plant diseases, so common we seldom notice them, and\r\nrightly so, for if we should attempt to control all\r\nthe miscellaneous leaf spots that appear in a small\r\nsuburban garden in a single season, we would\r\nquickly go mad. A typical leaf spot is a rather\r\ndefinitely delimited necrotic lesion, often with\r\na brown, sometimes white, center and a darker\r\nmargin. When the spots are so numerous they\r\ngrow together to form large dead areas, the disease becomes a blight, or perhaps a blotch, or\r\nscorch. Certain types of lesions are called\r\nanthracnose, spot anthracnose, blackspot. All of\r\nthese have been segregated out in their different\r\nsections. What is left is a very large collection of\r\nnames.\r\nThe genus Septoria, for instance, has about\r\n1000 species, Mycosphaerella 500, Cercospora\r\n400, chiefly identified by the hosts on which they\r\nappear. Cercospora beticola is so named because\r\nit causes a leaf spot of beet, C. apii for its celery\r\nhost. Species recorded in this country as causing\r\na definite disease are listed under their respective\r\nhosts. They are not repeated here unless the leaf\r\nspot is of some importance or there is some useful\r\ninformation that can be added to the name.\r\nMost leaf spot diseases flourish in wet seasons.\r\nA comparative few may be important enough to\r\ncall for control measures other than general sanitation. Adequate protection usually means several applications of fungicides, and the cost of\r\nspraying trees and shrubs must be balanced\r\nagainst the expected damage. Calling in a tree\r\nexpert with high-pressure apparatus is often an\r\nexpensive proposition. If the budget is limited,\r\nit is more important to have an elm sprayed for\r\nelm leaf beetles, which cause defoliation every\r\nseason, than for elm black spot, which may be\r\nserious in only one year out of three or four.\r\nWhen it comes to rose blackspot (no relation to\r\nelm black spot), weekly protection with\r\na fungicide is necessary, but to save labor it can\r\nbe combined with insecticides.\r\nActinothyrium\r\nDeuteromycetes, Coelomycetes\r\nPycnidia superficial, globose, with a more or less\r\nfimbriate shield; spores filiform, hyaline.\r\nActinopelte dryina (see \u25b6Tubakia dryina).\r\nOn oak.\r\nActinothyrium gloeosporioides (see\r\n\u25b6Tubakia dryina).

Occasionally citrus fruits as well as\r\nleaves are attacked.\r\nThe sporangia formed on the fine hairs germinate in moist weather, producing zoospores that\r\nenter through stomata and form mycelium-like\r\nchains of algal cells in host tissue. On twigs the\r\nalga invades outer cortical tissue, which may\r\nswell abnormally, crack, and afford entrance to\r\ninjurious fungi.

Usually the spots are confined to the\r\nupper half of leaves, but if plants are crowded\r\nand shaded and the summer is wet, the spotting\r\nappears earlier, covers more of the leaf, and is\r\nmore damaging.\r\nSpots are dark brown at first, surrounded by\r\na water-soaked and then yellowing region; they\r\nenlarge into rather oval lesions, up to 1/2 inch\r\nlong, with a red-brown border (Fig. 3). Flower\r\nbuds and stems of bulbous iris may be attacked.\r\nTufts of olive conidia turn the centers grayish, the\r\nspores being produced in abundance and splashed\r\nby rain to neighboring leaves. Infection is\r\nthrough stomata or directly through the epidermis. The fungus winters as mycelium in old\r\nleaves, and in spring produces a fresh crop of\r\nconidia or perithecia of the Didymellina stage.\r\nSoils deficient in lime apparently favor the disease. Repeated spotting reduces bloom and, after\r\na number of years, may kill plants.\r\nControl It is often sufficient to remove and burn\r\nall old leaves at the end of the season; shearing\r\nback spotted leaves in midsummer is helpful.

Under wet conditions lesions have small, pale centers with russet\r\nborders; in dry weather leaves wither as in\r\ndrought but with less evident spotting. Conidia\r\nare typically cylindrical, rounded at both ends,\r\nyellowish, and germinate from any or all cells\r\n(see Fig. 1).\r\nDrechslera giganteum (formerly\r\nHelminthosporium giganteum). Zonate Leaf\r\nSpot, Eye Spot on bent grasses, Canada and\r\nKentucky bluegrass, and Bermuda grass. The\r\ndisease is present in turf and in nursery rows.\r\nSpots are small, 1/16 to 1/8 inch, bleached-straw\r\ncolor in centers. In presence of moisture (dew is\r\nsufficient) the fungus grows periodically into new\r\nareas, giving the zoned appearance. In continued\r\nwet weather leaves are killed and grass turns\r\nbrown. Metropolitan and velvet bent grasses are\r\nless susceptible. Most injury is in July and\r\nAugust. The fungus overwinters as dormant\r\nmycelium in old leaves.\r\nDrechslera poae (formerly Helminthosporium\r\nvagans). Bluegrass Leaf Spot, Going-Out,\r\nMelting-out, Foot Rot, general but most injurious in northeastern states, on bluegrass only.\r\nScattered circular to elongate leaf spots, 0.5 to 3\r\nby 1 to 8 mm, have prominent reddish brown to\r\nblack borders; centers are brown changing to\r\nstraw-colored or white with age. The disease,\r\nfavored by cool rainy weather, usually appears\r\nin early spring, sometimes in late fall, and is\r\nmost severe on close-clipped turf. Grass thins\r\nout in large areas; roots rot; weeds invade\r\nexposed soil.\r\nControl Merion bluegrass is quite resistant to\r\nleaf spot and will stand close-clipping. For other\r\nbluegrasses cut high and fertilize well to help turf\r\nwithstand the disease.\r\nDrechslera siccans (formerly\r\nHelminthosporium siccans; Teleomorph,\r\nPyrenophora lolii). Brown Blight on fescue, and\r\nryegrass. Leaves die back with numerous dark\r\nchocolate-brown spots, oval to elongate and\r\noften coalescing. The disease appears in early\r\nspring in cool, moist weather.\r\nHelminthosporium 217"

The disease is\r\nmost serious in shady locations.\r\nMycosphaerella nigromaculans Black Stem\r\nSpot of cranberry, reported from all cranberry\r\nareas, often associated with red leaf spot. The\r\nfungus enters through leaves, grows down the\r\npetioles, and forms elongated black spots on the\r\nstems, which may be completely girdled, followed\r\nby defoliation. Fruiting bodies are produced in\r\nautumn on dead stems with ascospores discharged\r\nin rainy periods in spring. The anamorph state of\r\nthe fungus is a Ramularia nigromaculans.\r\nMycosphaerella nyssicola (Anamorph,\r\nPhyllosticta nyssae). Tupelo Leaf Spot, on sour\r\ngum and water tupelo. Purplish irregular blotches,\r\nan inch or more across, are scattered on upper leaf\r\nsurface with lower surface dark brown. There may\r\nbe heavy defoliation.

Leaf Spot of gooseberry, current. Numerous small brown spots with\r\ngrayish centers are formed on both sides of\r\nleaves; there may be premature defoliation. The\r\nfungus winters in leaves, producing ascospores in\r\nlate spring. Two sprays of bordeaux mixture plus\r\n1 pint of self-emulsifying cottonseed oil per 100\r\ngallons have given good control of leaf spot on\r\ngooseberries in New York.

Primarily a foliage disease, this may also appear on\r\nstems and pods. It starts with irregular brown\r\npatches on cotyledons, then reddish brown zones\r\non both sides of leaves, often with pale green or\r\nchlorotic zones surrounding the lesions. Spots may\r\ncover the whole leaf, defoliation starting from lowest leaves. Brown discolorations with indistinct\r\nmargins extend an inch or more along stems. The\r\npathogen winters in diseased leaves and in seed.\r\nSome varieties are quite resistant.

In seasons with moderate temperature\r\nand abundant rainfall enough foliage is destroyed\r\nso that fruits do not mature properly and are subject to sunscald. The disease appears at any age but\r\nmore often after fruit is set. Infection starts on\r\nolder leaves near the ground, with small, thickly\r\nscattered, water-soaked spots, which become\r\nroughly circular with gray centers and prominent\r\ndark margins. The spots are smaller, 1/16 to 1/8\r\ninch, and more numerous than those of early\r\nblight. Leaflets may die with progressive loss of\r\nfoliage from the bottom up. The pathogen winters\r\non tomato refuse and solanaceous weed hosts;\r\nspores are washed from pycnidia by rain or spread\r\nby brushing against moist leaves.

        "html": "Lichens\r\nA lichen is a fungus body, usually one of the\r\nAscomycetes with apothecia, enclosing a green\r\nor blue-green alga. The fungus receives some\r\nfood from the alga and the alga some food and\r\nprotection from the fungus, a relationship termed\r\nsymbiotic. Lichens frequently grow on living\r\ntrees and shrubs, but their injury is indirect, an\r\ninterference with light or gas exchange to stems\r\nor foliage, rather than from penetration of living\r\ncells of the suscept plant. There are three types\r\nassociated with plants: crustose, a crust closely\r\nappressed to bark of main trunk or larger limbs;\r\nfoliose, leaflike, prostrate but not so firmly\r\nattached to the substratum; and fructicose,\r\nbushlike, erect or hanging.\r\nLichens are more abundant on garden\r\nshrubs \u2013 boxwood, camellias, azaleas, and so\r\non \u2013 and on citrus in the South. They flourish\r\nin neglected gardens and orchards, and in shady\r\ndamp locations, and may sometimes kill twigs\r\nand branches of weak trees growing on poor\r\nsites.\r\nIn most gardens control is unnecessary. If\r\nlichens become too disfiguring or too abundant\r\nfor plant health, they may be killed by spraying\r\naffected parts with bordeaux mixture or other\r\ncopper spray; spray when the lichens are dry.\r\nThey may be removed from main trunks by\r\nrubbing the bark with a steel brush after they are\r\nsoftened by rain.\r\nR.K.

        "html": "Mistletoe\r\nMistletoes are seed plants belonging to the family\r\nViscaceae. They are semiparasites, manufacturing food but depending on a host plant for water\r\nand mineral salts. There are three genera in North\r\nAmerica: Phoradendron and Viscum which are\r\ntrue mistletoes, and Arceuthobium, dwarf\r\nmistletoe.\r\nThe mistletoe seed is naked embryo and endosperm invested with a fibrous coat and borne in\r\nwhite, straw-colored, pink, or red\r\nfruits \u2013 \u201cberries\u201d \u2013 embedded in a sticky gelatinous pulp enabling them to cling to bark of trees\r\nor stick to feet and beaks of birds, which disseminate them.\r\nThe seeds can germinate almost anywhere but\r\npenetrate only young thin bark, by means of\r\na haustorium sent out from a flattened\r\ndisc. Branches of the haustorium extend up and\r\ndown and around the tree and occasionally produce secondary haustoria. The number of annual\r\nrings on a tree between the tip of the primary\r\nhaustorium and the bark tells the age of the mistletoe. Many are 60 to 70 years old, and one has\r\nbeen reported as living 419 years. The aerial\r\nportions of mistletoes are leafy, evergreen tufts\r\nof shoots on the stems of host plants, most conspicuous on hardwoods after leaf fall (see Fig. 1).\r\nThe stems and leaves contain chlorophyll and are\r\ngreen but often with a yellowish, brown, or olive\r\ncast, depending on the season. All species have\r\nopposite leaves and round, jointed stems, and are\r\ndioecious with inconspicuous petal-less flowers.\r\nThey occasionally become so large or numerous\r\nthat the weight of the parasite breaks branches of\r\nthe host. Growth is slow at first, but in 6 to 8 years\r\nthe tufts may be 3 feet across. The aerial part does\r\nnot live much longer than that, but the haustoria\r\nlive as long as the tree, producing new bunches\r\nfrom adventitious buds.\r\nBecause they manufacture their own food, mistletoes require a lot of sun, which may be one\r\nreason why they flourish so in the Southwest.\r\nLeafy mistletoes are relatively harmless in some\r\nsituations; in others they handicap shade and forest\r\ntrees, and occasionally kill hackberries and oaks.\r\nThere are a few leaf spots and other fungus diseases that keep mistletoes from getting too abundant. They are harvested for Christmas greens with\r\na curved mistletoe hook, which can be used to\r\nkeep aerial portions cut off valuable trees. Breaking off or cutting off the bunches, however, may\r\nlead to more shoots in an ever-widening area.\r\nDwarf mistletoes are far more injurious, especially to forest trees, and much less conspicuous.\r\nIn western coniferous forests they rank next to\r\nheart rots in importance, reducing the quality and\r\nquantity of timber and paving the way for bark\r\nbeetle infestations. Infected branches should be\r\npruned out; if the trunk is infected, the tree should\r\nbe felled and removed.\r\nR.K.

        "html": "Nematodes\r\nIn the six decades since the first edition of this book\r\nwas prepared, nematodes have become of major\r\nimportance in plant pathology. It used to be stated\r\nthat plant pests, insects, and diseases, took a toll of\r\none-tenth of all our crops. Now we believe that\r\nnematodes alone may cause a 10 % crop loss, and\r\nsome place the figure as high as 25 %. The monetary loss is not easy to figure. Guesses range from\r\n$500,000 to $8 billion a year in the U. S. Nematodes\r\nmay be as damaging in home gardens as on farms.\r\nNematodes used to be considered primarily\r\na southern problem, with the root-knot nematode\r\nthe major culprit. Now we know that nematodes\r\ncan be as serious in Maine or Minnesota as in\r\nFlorida or Texas, and that root-knot species are\r\nresponsible for only a fraction of total losses.\r\nA 1957 report from Maryland states that samples were taken from around the roots of crop\r\nplants on 1210 different farms and gardens, and\r\nthat every sample included at least one species of\r\nnematode known to be a plant parasite, with rootknot nematodes making only 3.2 % of the total.\r\nA 1959 report from New Jersey states that, on the\r\nbasis of 2500 soil and root samples taken since\r\n1954, a very conservative estimate of annual loss\r\nin the state is $15 million. The root-knot nematodes which are reduced by cold winters, were in\r\nthird place because of their importance as pests of\r\ngreenhouse crops, including African-violets,\r\nroses, and other ornamentals, as well as vegetable\r\nseedlings. Nematodes (eelworms or roundworms) are threadlike animals in the phylum\r\nNematoda (or Nemata). The following two\r\nreferences were used in the nematode taxonomic\r\ndescriptions in this section:\r\nNickle WR (1991) Manual of agricultural\r\nnematology.

Nature\r\n392(6671):71\u201375.\r\nNematodes live in moist soil, water, decaying\r\norganic matter, and tissues of other living organisms. Some cause diseases of man or animals;\r\nothers cause plant diseases. The animal parasites\r\ninclude hookworms, pinworms, and the worms in\r\npork causing trichinosis, and they range in length\r\nfrom less than an inch to nearly a yard. Most plant\r\nparasites are practically microscopic in size,\r\nsometimes just barely visible to the naked eye.\r\nThey mostly range from 0.5 to 2 mm long, or\r\nfrom 1/50 to 1/10 inch.\r\nNematode diseases of plants are not new. The\r\nwheat eelworm was recorded more than two centuries ago (in 1743); root knot has been\r\na recognized problem since 1855. Our systematic\r\ninvestigation of plant parasitic nematodes is very\r\nnew. Only in the past few years have we made\r\nsurveys to find out how widespread nematodes\r\nare and how many cases of \u201cdecline\u201d in plants are\r\ndue to them. Nematodes injure plants directly by\r\ntheir feeding, causing cell death or gross modifications and general stunting, and indirectly by\r\naffording entrance to bacteria and fungi causing\r\nR.K.

Some nematodes also are vectors\r\nof ring spots and other virus diseases.\r\nMany nematodes may merely live in the soil\r\nclose to the plant and cause no damage, and a few\r\nare actually beneficial, feeding on such harmful\r\npests as Japanese beetle grubs. Only an expert\r\nnematologist can determine species and decide\r\nwhich are responsible for a plant\u2019s ill health. In\r\nsubmitting samples to your experiment station for\r\ndiagnosis, dig up roots and some surrounding\r\nsoil, place immediately in a plastic bag to prevent\r\ndrying out, and mail as soon as possible.\r\nPlant parasitic nematodes may be sedentary or\r\nmigratory. They do not move through soil to any\r\ngreat distance. Major dispersal is by shipment of\r\ninfested nursery stock and soil; locally nematodes\r\nare spread on tools, and feet, in irrigation water,\r\nin plant parts, and sometimes as dry cysts by the\r\nwind. Plant nematodes are facultative or obligate\r\nparasites. They may be endoparasitic, living\r\ninside roots or other tissues, or ectoparasitic, living outside the plant, inserting only the head for\r\nfeeding; and some forms are intermediate\r\nbetween the two types. Most plant nematodes\r\nare root parasites, but some live in stems, bulbs,\r\nleaves, or buds. Some cause galls or other distinctive symptoms; others produce a general\r\nyellowing, stunting, or dieback that is often\r\nascribed to other causes.\r\nNematodes are usually long and cylindrical,\r\ntapering at both ends, round in cross section. In\r\nsome genera the female is pear-shaped or saclike,\r\nbut the male is always vermiform. Nematodes in\r\ngeneral lack coloration, being transparent or with\r\na whitish or yellowish tint. They are covered with\r\na cuticle, made up of three main layers, largely\r\nprotein, under which is a cellular layer called the\r\nhypodermis. The body cavity, pseudocoel, is\r\nfilled with fluid. The body wall musculature,\r\ndirectly beneath the hypodermis, consists of longitudinal fibers only. This means that nematodes\r\ncannot contract transversely. They move through\r\nmoist soil with a threshing motion, or a series of\r\nundulations.\r\nNematodes have a complete digestive tract\r\nwith a mouth at the anterior end. This is\r\nsurrounded by lips bearing the sensory organs,\r\nbut there is no true head, and nematodes lack eyes\r\nand nose. Basically there are six lips, but they\r\nmay be fused in pairs. The sense organs, amphids,\r\nare important diagnostic characters, one class of\r\nnematodes having amphids with conspicuous\r\nopenings, the other having amphids with minute\r\npores. Most plant parasitic nematodes belong to\r\nthe latter group.\r\nBehind the mouth there is a cavity (stoma),\r\nthen the esophagus, the intestine, and the rectum.\r\nThe latter terminates in a ventral terminal or\r\nsubterminal anus in females, in a cloacal opening\r\nin males. The sexes are usually separate, but\r\nsometimes males are missing and females are\r\nhermaphroditic. The body region behind the\r\nanus or cloacal opening is called the tail.\r\nNear the posterior end of many nematodes\r\nthere is a pair of cuticular pouches called phasmids, believed to be sense organs like the\r\namphids. They are used to divide nematodes\r\ninto two main groups, the Secernentea, or\r\nPhasmidia, with phasmids, and the Adenophorea,\r\nwithout phasmids.\r\nAll of the plant parasitic nematodes feed by\r\nmeans of a stylet, which works something like\r\na hypodermic needle. It is a conspicuous protrusible spear used to puncture tissue. In most families this is a stomatostylet, a hollow spear\r\nderived from the sclerotized walls of the buccal\r\ncavity or stoma. Commonly the nematode punctures plant tissue with its stylet, then injects\r\na secretion from its salivary gland that predigests\r\nthe food before it is sucked in through the stylet.\r\nIn the family Dorylaimidae the spear is an\r\nenlarged tooth, odontostylet, originating in the\r\nesophagus wall. It is usually hollow, but in the\r\ngenus Trichodorusthe tooth (onchiostyle) is solid\r\nbut grooved.\r\nThe structure of the esophagus varies in different groups and is an important diagnostic character. The esophagus commonly has one or two\r\nswellings, known as bulbs. Those provided with\r\na glandular apparatus are true bulbs; those\r\nlacking such apparatus are pseudobulbs. True\r\nbulbs are the chief pumping and sucking structures. They may be median, situated at midlength,\r\nor posterior, at the end of the esophagus.\r\nControl measures for nematodes include crop\r\nrotation and other cultural practices and soil\r\n252 Nematodes"

This is a cold-weather species,\r\npersisting through the winter with several thousand nematodes present in a single bud as leaves\r\nunfold in spring. The foliage is small twisted,\r\nthickened, glossy, with swollen petioles; blossom\r\nbuds are killed or poor, and no fruit is set. Some\r\nplants are killed; others recover.\r\nAs the fern nematode, or begonia leaf blight\r\nnematode, this species is recorded on anemone,\r\naquatic plants (Cabomba sp., Limnophila sp.,\r\nPeplis sp., and Potamogeton sp.), begonia,\r\nbouvardia, calceolaria, chrysanthemum, clematis, coleus, crassula, dianthus, doronicum, fern,\r\ngeranium, hosta, hydrangea, Lamium, lily,\r\npeony, primrose, saintpaulia, scabiosa, zinnia,\r\nand other ornamentals. Fern leaves have\r\na patchy or blotched appearance with dark\r\nbrown to black areas on the fronds. In some\r\nspecies these are rather narrow dark bands from\r\nmidrib to border, limited by parallel side veins; in\r\nbird\u2019s-nest fern there is a profuse brown discoloration from the base halfway up the leaf.\r\nOn begonias the disease is most serious on\r\nsemituberous varieties grown in greenhouses.\r\nSmall brown spots with water-soaked margins,\r\non underside of leaves, enlarge, coalesce, turn\r\ndark brown, and become visible on the upper\r\nsurface. Whole leaves may turn dark; plants\r\nmay be stunted. On fibrous-rooted begonias\r\nspots stay small, and leaves become shiny with\r\na tendency to curl, lose color, and drop. Nematodes are spattered from plant to plant by syringing or careless watering; there is no disease\r\nspread when foliage is kept dry.\r\nDieback of Easter lilies grown in the Northwest is also attributed to this bud and leaf nematode. Leaves are first blotched with yellow, then\r\nturn brownish, drooping and curling against the\r\nstem (see Fig. 1). The nematodes live over in the\r\nbulbs and are splashed from leaves of one plant to\r\nanother in the field.

Nematodes in such pustules probably\r\nenter leaves as they push up through the soil.\r\nBulbs badly diseased at planting produce no\r\nfoliage, or a few leaves that are premature,\r\ntwisted, and bent.\r\nWhen leaves are dry, nematodes are inactive;\r\nbut when the foliage is moist and decayed, they\r\nrevive and pass down into the soil or the neck of\r\nthe bulb. They enter bulb scales, move down to\r\nthe basal plate, and then enter the base of other\r\nscales. Infected scales are brown, and, since there\r\nis little lateral movement of nematodes, the cut\r\nsurface of a bulb shows one or more brown rings\r\ncontrasting with healthy tissue. Eggs, larvae, and\r\nadults are all present in the brown areas. Male and\r\nfemale adults are wormlike, up to 1.9 mm long.\r\nInfective larvae issue in large numbers in whitish\r\ntufts in a break between basal plate and scales,\r\nand work through the soil to invade adjacent\r\nplants.\r\nThey are also spread in irrigation water, on\r\ntools, and by animals. Some winter in weed\r\nhosts, some in seed of composites. In moist soil\r\nthey die in a year or so, but they have been\r\nrecovered from plants after 5 or 6 years. The\r\nstrain on phlox attacks campanula, sweet william, evening primrose, goldenrod, schizanthus,\r\nanemone, foxglove, and orchids. The leaves\r\nare very narrow, crinkled, and waved, often brittle, with a tendency to lengthen petioles. Stems\r\nmay be swollen near the top or bent sidewise;\r\nplants are stunted, often fail to bloom, may\r\ndie prematurely. The nematodes enter through\r\nstomata of young shoots and work upward\r\nas the stems develop. They infest seed of\r\nphlox and other composites, and may be so\r\ndisseminated.\r\nIn onions the inner bulb scales are enlarged,\r\ncausing a split onion that seldom flowers and\r\nsometimes rots at the base. Seedlings are twisted,\r\nstunted, covered with yellow spots. On plants\r\ngrown from sets, a slight stunting and flaccid\r\ncondition of outer leaves is followed by leaf-tip\r\nnecrosis and continued stunting. The larvae may\r\nlive long in infested soil and may be carried in set\r\nonions.\r\nControl Commercial growers routinely treat\r\nnarcissus bulbs in hot water, 4 h at 110\u0001 to\r\n112 \u0001F. All infected plants, parts, and debris\r\nshould be removed from fields and destroyed;\r\na 2-to 4-year rotation may be tried. Take up and\r\nburn infested phlox or similar plants. Put new\r\nplants in a new location or in fumigated soil.\r\nDitylenchus (Sychnotylenchus) gallicus On\r\nelm.\r\nDitylenchus iridis Probably a strain of\r\nD. dipsaci, on bulbous iris. Mildly infected plants\r\ndry up prematurely and have poor root systems.\r\nHeavily infected plants are stunted, having\r\nfew if any roots, and the bulbs decay before\r\nharvest. Treat bulbs with hot water as for narcissus, but soak only 3 h and as soon after curing as\r\npossible.\r\nDitylenchus 257"

Cyst nematodes, highly specific,\r\nattacking members of but few genera in a given\r\nplant family, partially endoparasitic, quite sedentary, attached to root by neck only. The female is\r\nlemon-shaped to globoid, white, yellow, or\r\nbrown, 0.5 to 0.75 mm. Eggs are deposited or\r\nretained in body of mother, whose leathery wall\r\nforms a true cyst. Eggs remain alive for years in\r\ncysts, which are spread by wind or in soil around\r\nnonhost plants. Males are slender worms, up to\r\n1.75 mm. Root-knot nematodes, formerly all\r\nclassed as Heterodera marioni, have been\r\nreclassified as various species of Meloidogyne.\r\nThe stylet Heterodera is twice as long as that in\r\nMeloidogyne, and the latter does not form true\r\ncysts.\r\nGlobodera rostochiensis (formerly Heterodera\r\nrostochiensis). Golden Nematode on white potatoes, also eggplant, tomato, and other members of\r\nthe Solanaceae, but not on tobacco. It was first\r\ndiscovered in the United States on Long Island in\r\n1941, and it was kept there, by a rigorous quarantine, until 1967, when it was found at a single\r\nlocation in upstate New York. In 1968, it was\r\nfound on a potato farm in Delaware. Known as\r\n\u201cpotato sickness,\u201d the disease has been serious in\r\nthe British Isles for many years. Crops do not\r\nshow much damage until heavy populations\r\nhave built up in the soil; then there is midday\r\nwilting, stunting, poor root development, early\r\ndeath, with up to 85 % reduction in potato yield.\r\nThe eggs live in the soil inside cysts barely visible\r\nto the naked eye. Each may contain up to 500\r\neggs, and some hatch one year, some another.\r\nCysts have remained viable 17 years. In spring,\r\nwhen soil temperature is around 60 \u0001F, a chemical\r\ngiven off by potato or tomato roots stimulates\r\nhatching, and the larvae (which have had a first\r\nmolt inside the egg) leave the cysts and migrate to\r\nhost plants, entering the roots. The females\r\nbecome stationary, swell to pear shape, and\r\nbreak through the roots, remaining attached by\r\na thin neck. The cylindrical males work out of the\r\nroots and cluster around to mate with the females.\r\nEggs are formed, and the dead female becomes\r\nthe cyst, first white, then gold, orange, finally\r\nbrown. Cysts detached from roots remain in the\r\nsoil or may be spread in potato bags, crates,\r\nmachinery, even in trouser cuffs of farm workers.\r\nLily-of-the-valley pips, cacti, and other plants\r\nintercepted at quarantine have had golden nematode cysts in fragments of soil around the roots.\r\nControl A quarantine restricts movement of\r\npotatoes, nursery stock, root crops and top soil\r\nfrom infested land. Healthy potatoes are sold in\r\npaper bags to prevent reinfestation from secondhand burlap bags. The Peconic strain of potato is\r\nsaid to be resistant; Rosa, Elba, and NY 71 are\r\nalso resistant.\r\nHeterodera avenae Oat Cyst Nematode on\r\npea.\r\nHeterodera cacti Cactus Cyst Nematode.\r\nObtained from various localities in Mexico,\r\nwhere it is probably indigenous, and likely to\r\noccur on cacti wherever grown.

On grapes. Males developed\r\nin soil and have a degenerate esophagus that lacks\r\na stylet.\r\nMeloidogyne\r\nHeteroderidae. Root-knot nematodes, formerly\r\nconsidered one species, now known to be several,\r\ndistinguished by slight morphological differences such as striations, perineal pattern of the\r\ntail, type of galls formed, host preferences, and\r\nsomewhat by locality. Females are white, pearshaped to sphaeroid with elongated necks, slender stylets with well-developed basal knobs;\r\nmales are slender, wormlike. Females deposit\r\neggs in a gelatinous mass, and the body is not\r\nturned into a cyst as in Heterodera (see Fig. 3).\r\nRoot knot is the best known nematode disease,\r\nwith over 2000 plant species susceptible to one or\r\nmore forms of Meloidogyne. Root knot was first\r\nreported in England, in 1865 on cucumbers; in\r\n1876 it was recorded in the United States on\r\nviolet. Infected plants are stunted; they often\r\nwilt, turn yellow, and die. The chief diagnostic\r\nsymptom is the presence of small or large swellings or galls in the roots (see Fig. 4). They are\r\nnearly round or long and irregular, but they are an\r\nintegral part of the root and cannot be broken off.\r\nThis differentiates them from beneficial nodules,\r\nformed on legume roots by nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which can be readily broken off.\r\nRoot-knot nematodes occur in practically\r\nevery state. We used to think they were killed\r\nby northern winters, but some species can survive\r\nextreme cold. They do have fewer generations in\r\nthe North and do not build up such large\r\npopulations as in southern sandy or peat soils.\r\nGrasses and grains are about the only plants\r\nimmune or resistant to root knot.\r\nThe long, thin young larva takes form inside\r\nthe egg, breaks out, and migrates through the soil\r\nto a root. It moves in to the axial cylinder and\r\nthere becomes sedentary. It injects a secretion of\r\nits esophageal glands into the tissue by means of\r\nits short buccal stylet, and this stimulates the\r\nformation of 3 to 5 giant cells around the injection\r\npoint. The nematode absorbs its food from these\r\nnectarial cells the rest of its life. As it feeds, the\r\nlarva swells rapidly into a sausage-shaped body,\r\nwhich, in the female, becomes whitish and pearshaped, large enough to be just visible to the\r\nFig. 3 Root-Knot\r\nNematode Galls on Potato\r\nMeloidogyne 261"

The male changes into a threadlike\r\ncylindrical form, folded up inside the larval molt,\r\nfrom which it finally escapes.\r\nThe female deposits its eggs in an extruded\r\nyellow-brown jelly. There may be up to 3000; the\r\naverage is nearer 300 to 500. The larvae develop\r\ninside the eggs and become free in the soil when\r\nthe host root cracks or decays. They may attack\r\nthe same root in a new place or another root. At\r\n80 \u0001F a generation takes only 25 days; at 67 \u0001F the\r\ncycle averages 87 days, and below 55 \u0001F activity\r\nceases.

Probably as widespread as a group as root-knot nematodes and even more serious, though less readily\r\nrecognized. The brown or black root condition\r\nusually comes from secondary fungi entering and\r\nrotting the roots after cells are pierced and torn by\r\nthe nematodes. In boxwood and other ornamentals there is often a brush or witches\u2019 broom of\r\nnew surface roots to compensate for old roots\r\nsloughed off. First symptoms are usually yellow,\r\nblack, or brown lesions on fine feeder roots. Boxwood becomes sickly, stunted; foliage is dark\r\nbrown to orange, sometimes drops; some\r\nbranches may be killed.

Citrus decline was known for many years\r\nbefore the nematode connection was made in\r\n1953. This species is also responsible for AVOCADO DECLINE and in 1963 was reported as\r\ninfesting 237 plants in many families. Possible\r\nhosts include acanthus, allamanda, aluminum\r\nplant, calathea, Barbados cherry, banana, castorbean, cocculus, hibiscus, Japanese boxwood, Japanese persimmon, ixora, jacobinia, gingerlily,\r\nloquat, Momordica, pandanus, peperomia, philodendron, periwinkle, pothos, podocarpus, palms,\r\nguava, as well as corn, pepper, tomato, and other\r\nvegetables, and various trees. Asparagus, marigold, and crotalaria are among the few nonhosts.\r\nThe burrowing nematode has been found in Louisiana as well as central Florida.\r\nThe nematodes enter the cortical parenchyma\r\nof young succulent roots just back of the tip and\r\nform burrows, leaving behind avenues of infection for soil fungi and bacteria. Infected trees\r\nseldom die outright, but have poor growth and\r\ncease to produce a profitable crop. The disease\r\nspreads in all directions from an infected specimen, but somewhat unevenly, the distance ranging from 25 to 200 feet in a year, averaging about\r\n50 feet. Long-distance spread is by transplants\r\nfrom nurseries.\r\nControl Living trees, once infected, cannot be\r\nrestored to vigor.

        "html": "Nonparasitic Diseases\r\nPlants in poor health from one or more environmental conditions far outnumber those afflicted\r\nwith diseases caused by parasites \u2013 bacteria,\r\nfungi, and nematodes. When foliage turns yellow\r\nfrom lack of nitrogen, or from unavailability of\r\niron in an alkaline soil, or from lack of oxygen in\r\na waterlogged soil, we call it a physiological or\r\nphysiogenic or nonparasitic disease. The adverse\r\ncondition may be continuing, as it is with\r\na nutrient deficiency, or it may be transitory, an\r\nice storm, perhaps, lasting but a day but with\r\nresultant dieback continuing for the next two\r\nyears. It may be chemical injury from injudicious\r\nspraying or fertilizing or from toxic substances in\r\nthe atmosphere. It may be due to a toxin injected\r\nby an insect.\r\nTrees and crops can be insured against hail,\r\nhurricanes, lightning, and other acts of God, but\r\nnot the misguided zeal of gardeners. Years of\r\nworking in gardens in my own state and visiting\r\ngardens in other states from coast to coast have\r\nconvinced me that plants often suffer more from\r\ntheir owners than from pests and diseases. Azaleas die from an overdose of aluminum sulfate\r\napplied to correct acidity, when the original cause\r\nof ill health was a too-wet soil. Rhododendron die\r\nwhen a deep, soggy mass of maple or other \u201csoft\u201d\r\nleaves is kept around the trunks. Roses die when\r\nthe beds are edged with a spade and soil is\r\nmounded up in the center, burying some plants\r\ntoo deeply and exposing roots of others. Seedlings die from an overdose of fertilizer in hot\r\nweather. Trees die from grading operations.\r\nSpray injury is exceedingly common, with the\r\ngardener thinking the red or brown spots are\r\nfungus leaf spots and increasing the chemical\r\ndosage until all foliage is lost. Weed killers take\r\ntheir unexpected toll of nearby ornamentals.\r\nEither a deficiency or an excess of plant nutrients\r\ncan cause a physiological disease. Greenhouse\r\noperators and commercial growers in the field\r\nmust watch nutrition very carefully. The backyard farmer gets along pretty well by using\r\na \u201ccomplete\u201d fertilizer containing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in large amounts and\r\nminor elements in trace amounts. There are kits\r\navailable for amateur diagnosticians who wish to\r\ncheck soil deficiencies and acidity, but you may\r\nprefer to send a soil sample to your state experiment station for a correct interpretation of nutrients and soil acidity. Take a slice through the soil\r\nto spade or trowel depth from several places in\r\nthe garden, mix those samples together, and send\r\na small sample of the mixture.\r\nAcidity, Excess\r\nSoil acidity or alkalinity is measured on a pH\r\nscale that runs from 0 to 14. When the number\r\nof acid or hydrogen ions balances the number of\r\nalkaline or hydroxyl ions, we have pH7.0 or neutral. Above pH 7.0 the soil is alkaline and may\r\ncontain free lime; below it, the soil is acid. Few\r\ncrop plants will grow below pH 3.5 or above pH\r\n9.0. If the soil becomes very acid, roots are poorly\r\nR.K. Horst, Westcott\u2019s Plant Disease Handbook, DOI 10.1007/978-94-007-2141-8_39,\r\n# Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013\r\n269"

This result is due\r\neither to actual excess of hydrogen ions or to\r\nphysical structure of the soil and solubility of\r\nnutrients.\r\nMost flowering plants, fruits, and vegetables\r\ndo well in a soil just slightly acid, in a pH range of\r\n6 to 7 or 6 to 8. Plants flourishing in a very acid\r\nsoil, pH 4 to 5, are few: alpines, azalea, arbutus,\r\nand romeda, bunchberry, wild calla, camellia,\r\nChamaecyparis (white cedar), a few ferns, wild\r\norchids, pitcher-plants, galax, and mountain-ash.\r\nIn the pH 5 to 6 list are: arbutus-tree, azalea,\r\nbleeding-heart, birch, blueberry, bent grasses,\r\nbracken, camellia, Carolina jessamine, Clarkia,\r\ncranberry, cypress, Daphne odora (but not\r\nD. mezerium, which is in the 6 to 8 group), hemlock, juniper, mountain-laurel, some ferns, some\r\norchids, some oaks, pine, rhododendron, sour\r\ngum, spruce, silver-bell tree, Styrax, strawberry,\r\nsweet potato, and yew.\r\nThe small kits for home testing of soils include\r\na booklet giving the pH preferences of a long list\r\nof plants and the amount of lime required to\r\ncorrect the acidity. This varies with the type of\r\nsoil and the original pH. To bring a sandy soil\r\nfrom pH 4 to above 6 takes only 1/2 pound of\r\nhydrated lime; it takes 2 pounds of lime to effect\r\nthe same change in a clay soil.\r\nAir Pollution\r\nPolluted air is not confined to cities. Even in the\r\ncountry crops suffer when sunlight plus automobile exhaust produce ozone and other gases. Air\r\npollutants come from smelters, pulp mills, factories, power plants, incinerators, and other\r\nsources. Ozone injury is common in pine,\r\nresulting in chlorotic and needle mottling,\r\ntipburn, blight, needle flecking, and stunting; in\r\ntobacco, causing \u201cweather fleck\u201d; in spinach,\r\nwith oily areas followed by white necrotic spots\r\non upper leaf surface; in grape, with a dark stippling. Other sensitive plants include bean, celery,\r\ncorn, tomato, carnation, orchid, radish, marigold,\r\nand petunias. Some varieties are more susceptible\r\nthan others. Smog occurs from a chemical\r\nreaction of unburned hydrocarbons, as from automobiles, ozone, sunlight, and, usually, thermal\r\ninversion. Tremendous losses in California\r\norchid houses come when smog appears when\r\nplants are in the budding stage.\r\nChrysanthemums may be prevented from\r\nflowering by ethylene in the atmosphere; tomatoes\r\nare also very sensitive. Injury from sulfur dioxide,\r\na product of fuel combustion, is at a high level in\r\nthe colder months. Foliage has white spots, tips, or\r\nmargins. Soot particles entering houses from\r\nsmokestacks cause necrotic spots.\r\nControl For orchids and other high-priced\r\ngreenhouse crops, air can be passed through\r\na filter of activated charcoal.

Increasing the\r\nvitamin C content of plants by treating them with\r\na substance such as potassium ascorbate may\r\nreduce injury from ozone. Installation of purification devices in automobiles and industrial\r\nplants may provide some future relief.\r\nAlkali Injury\r\nSome semiarid soils are nearly barren from\r\nexcess of chemicals with a basic reaction. Composition varies, but three common salts are\r\nsodium chloride, sulfate of soda, and carbonate\r\nof soda; these salts become concentrated at the\r\nsoil surface with a whitish incrustation. Other\r\nsoils are black alkali, where the organic matter\r\nhas been dissolved. Applications of gypsum or\r\nsulfur, cultivation, and mulching are correctives.\r\nAlkalinity\r\nEither aluminum sulfate or sulfur, or both mixed\r\ntogether, can be used to reduce the pH for plants\r\ndoing best in a somewhat acid soil.\r\nAluminum Toxicity\r\nOccasional, if aluminum is used in excess.

Even apple trees can be severely\r\ninjured by arsenical sprays under some conditions.\r\nBaldhead\r\nIn beans this is loss of the growing point, due to\r\nmechanical injury in threshing seed.\r\nBitter Pit\r\nOn apples this is called stippen or Baldwin spot\r\nand is characterized by small, circular, slightly\r\nsunken spots on fruit, increasing in storage, especially at warm temperatures, most frequent on\r\nvarieties Jonathan, Baldwin, Spy, Rhode Island\r\nGreening. It seems to be related to fluctuation of\r\nthe moisture supply in soil and increased by\r\nabundant rainfall shortly before harvest. On\r\npear, bitter pit is sometimes associated with moisture deficiency; in olives, with overnutrition.\r\nBlack End\r\nIn pear, the whole blossom end of the fruit may turn\r\nblack and dry; the disease appears when oriental\r\npear rootstocks are used in poor soil. In walnut,\r\nblack end of nuts is probably drought injury.\r\nBlack Heart\r\nIn beets, this is generally boron deficiency (see\r\nbelow); occasionally it is potassium or phosphorus deficiency. In apple wood it may be freezing\r\ninjury; in potatoes, lack of oxygen; in celery,\r\nfluctuating soil moisture.\r\nBlack Root\r\nDefective soil drainage and accumulation of\r\ntoxins are associated with black roots, but so too\r\nare soil fungi and root nematodes.\r\nBlasting\r\nBlasting of influorescence and failure to produce\r\nseeds. These symptoms seem associated with\r\nextremes of soil moisture, too wet or too dry, at\r\nblossom time. Onion Blast, prevalent in the Connecticut Valley, appears within a few hours after\r\nbright sunshine follows cloudy, wet weather.\r\nLeaf tips are first white, then brown.\r\nBlindness\r\nBlindness of tulips and other bulbs. Failure to\r\nflower may be due to Botrytis blight or other\r\ndisease, but it may come from root failure in dry\r\nsoil or from heating of bulbs in storage or transit.\r\nToo early forcing may result in blindness.\r\nBlossom-End Rot\r\nVery common on tomatoes, also on pepper,\r\nsquash, watermelon. The tissues at the blossom\r\nend of the fruit shrink, causing a dark, flattened or\r\nsunken, leathery spot, which may include nearly\r\nhalf the fruit (see Fig. 1). The disease is most\r\ncommon on plants that have had an excess of\r\nrainfall in the early part of the season, followed\r\nby a period of drought. There are, however, various contributing factors, the most important\r\nbeing a deficiency of calcium, which is needed\r\nfor synthesis of rigid cell walls of the tomato.\r\nAdding calcium oxide to the soil or spraying\r\nwith 1 % calcium chloride has reduced the disease. For home gardens, deep soil preparation,\r\nuse of a complete balanced fertilizer, and\r\nmulching to conserve moisture should help.\r\nBlossom-End Rot 271"

In the South, where plants\r\ncome out of dormancy early, orchard heaters,\r\nsmudge fires, power fans, and airplanes flying\r\nlow to stir up the air are all used to help save the\r\ncrop. Many ornamentals are injured when a long,\r\nwarm autumn ends in a sudden very cold snap, or\r\nwarm weather in February or March is followed\r\nby heavy frosts. Cracks in tree trunks come from\r\nsuch temperature fluctuations.\r\nGas Toxicity\r\nIlluminating gas escaping from aging gas mains\r\ncauses slow decline or sudden death, depending\r\non the plant.

Similarly, many trees die when\r\nthey are covered over with fill from house excavations. Roots require oxygen for survival, and\r\na sudden excess of soil cuts off most of the supply. A tree expert should be on hand to give\r\nadvice before any digging starts. Afterward is\r\ntoo late.

There is often a browning of tip or margin\r\nof leaves. Lime sulfur is injurious to some plants\r\nin any weather, russeting peach foliage, causing\r\napple drop, etc. When roses or other plants are\r\ncontinuously dusted with sulfur over a period of\r\nyears, the soil may become too acid and require\r\nlime as a corrective.\r\nSunscald\r\nTrees with smooth bark are subject to sunscald\r\nwhen trunks or branches are suddenly exposed to\r\nthe sun, as when the next tree is removed. Young\r\ntrees are subject to sunscald the first year or two\r\nafter planting and should have trunks wrapped in\r\nburlap or sprayed with a protective wax to prevent\r\nthe cambium under the thin bark from drying out.\r\nBoxwood foliage is subject to sunscald in\r\nspring after winter covering is removed, particularly if this is done on a sunny day with drying\r\nwinds. Sunscald is common on green tomatoes\r\nwhen fruits are exposed to sun in hot dry weather\r\n(Fig. 6). This happens when foliage is lost through\r\ndisease or excessive irrigation, or when too much\r\nis removed in training tomatoes to a single stem.\r\nA yellow or white patch appears on the side of the\r\ntomato nearest the sun, often developing into\r\na blister, then into a large, flattened spot with\r\na papery white surface darkened by the growth of\r\nsecondary fungi and internal decay.\r\nSunstroke\r\nOutright killing in excessive heat.\r\nTipburn\r\nPotassium deficiency may produce a tipburn, but\r\nmore often this is a reaction to heat, common in\r\npotatoes and particularly in lettuce, which shows\r\nmarginal browning of leaves and small brown or\r\nblack spots in tissues near larger veins.

It is impossible adequately to clean out such a sprayer; mark it with\r\nred paint and keep it for weeds only. Symptoms\r\nof injury are curling, twisting, and other distortions; there is often a fern-leaf effect instead of\r\nnormal-size foliage (Fig. 7). I have seen roses\r\nseriously malformed when a factory several hundred feet away mixed up some 2,4-D. I have seen\r\ntall oaks with all leaves unrecognizable after\r\npowdered 2,4-D was applied to the lawn.

The same\r\nword is used for the fungus causing the disease.\r\nMildews are Ascomycetes. Black mildews are\r\nparasites in the order Meliolales with a dark\r\nmycelium to give a sooty effect. They are common in the South or on tropical plants in greenhouses (\u25b6 Black Mildew). Powdery mildews are\r\nplant parasites in the order Erysiphales. They\r\nhave white mycelium, in a delicate weft or thick\r\nfelt, made up of a criss-cross tangle of hyphae.\r\nColorless spores borne in chains on upright\r\nconidophores give the white powdery effect (see\r\nFig. 1). False or downy mildews are oomycetes,\r\nand the conspicuous growth is not vegetative\r\nmycelium but fruiting structures and conidia protruding through stomata or epidermis to give\r\na white frosty appearance in moist weather\r\n(\u25b6 Downy Mildews).\r\nTrue powdery mildews \u2013 and in speaking of\r\nthem we usually eliminate the word\r\n\u201cpowdery\u201d \u2013 are widely distributed but sometimes more abundant in semiarid regions than in\r\nareas of high rainfall, where other diseases flourish. Unlike those of most other fungi, powdery\r\nmildew spores do not require free water for germination. Some species require high humidity,\r\nbut it is usually provided at the leaf surface\r\nwhen cold nights change to warm days or when\r\nplants are grown in crowded, low, or shady locations without sufficient air circulation. Spores of\r\nother species can germinate with very low humidity. When a mildew spore lands on a leaf and puts\r\nout its germ tube, it does not make its nearest way\r\ninside the leaf but produces a tangle of septate\r\nthreads, hyphae, on the surface. Special sucking\r\norgans, haustoria, penetrate the epidermal cells,\r\noccasionally the subepidermal cells, in search of\r\nfood. The penetrating tube is slender, but, once\r\ninside the cells, the haustorium becomes a round\r\nor pear-shaped enlargement or a branched affair,\r\nwith greatly increased absorbing surface.\r\nCondiophores, growing at right angles from the\r\nmycelium, produce one-celled conidia in rows or\r\nchains of somewhat barrel-shaped hyaline cells,\r\nwhich become oval as they are dislodged from the\r\ntop of the chain and disseminated by wind. Mildews known only in this anamorph state are called\r\nby the form genus name Oidium. It requires the\r\nsexual fruiting bodies, perithecia, to place mildews\r\nin their proper genera.\r\nPerithecia are round with a dark membranous\r\nwall, technically cleistothecia because they have\r\nno beak or ostiole, and rupture irregularly to free\r\nthe asci. They are held in place in the mycelium\r\nby appendages. The form of these appendages\r\nand the number of asci in the perithecium are\r\nthe chief characters differentiating the six genera\r\nimportant in this country (see Fig. 2).\r\nSphaerotheca and Erysiphe both have simple\r\nappendages; but the former has only one ascus,\r\nthe latter several. Podosphaera has appendage\r\ntips dichotomously branched and one ascus;\r\nMicrosphaera has the same type of appendage\r\nbut several asci. Phyllactinia has lancelike\r\nappendages swollen at the base; those of\r\nUncinula are coiled at the tip. Both have more\r\nthan one ascus.\r\nR.K.

Powdery Mildew of cherry, occasional on plum, peach, apricot, apple, pear, quince,\r\nhawthorn, serviceberry, spirea. Budded sour\r\ncherry is most severely attacked, but the disease\r\nis seldom serious except on nursery stock. Young\r\nleaves and twigs are covered with a white mycelium and powdery spores. Leaves are curled\r\nupward; terminal leaves are smaller; twig growth\r\nis stunted. Sulfur sprays or dusts will control.\r\nPodosphaera pannosa (formerly Sphaerotheca\r\npannosa var. rosae). Rose Mildew, general on\r\nrose; distinct from peach mildew but apparently\r\nnot confined to rose, since apricots growing near\r\nroses have been infected. More than one strain\r\nmay be involved. Rose mildew is found wherever\r\nroses grow. Always a problem with greenhouse\r\nroses, it was enhanced when aerosol treatments\r\nfor red spiders and other pests were substituted\r\nfor old-fashioned syringing. Mildew increased in\r\ngarden roses when ferbam and other new\r\norganics replaced the old sulfur and copper in\r\nthe blackspot sprays. Rose mildew is omnipresent\r\nalong the Pacific Coast and is serious in the semiarid Southwest. In the East, it appears on smallflowered ramblers such as Dorothy Perkins and\r\nCrimson Rambler in May, and may be quite serious on hybrid teas and some floribundas in late\r\nsummer, with the advent of cool nights.\r\nThe first symptom may be a slight curling of\r\nleaves, with the mycelial growth such a light and\r\nevanescent weft as to be almost unnoticed. Later\r\nthe white coating is conspicuous from the chains of\r\nconidia produced lavishly over the surface. The\r\ncoating may cover buds, resulting in no bloom or\r\ndistorted flowers. Leaves often have a reddish or\r\npurplish cast under the white mycelium and sometimes turn black. They may be slightly blistered.\r\nOn canes, the growth is heavier and more felty,\r\nespecially near thorns. Toward the end of the season perithecia may be found on canes, but they are\r\nnot common, and I have not seen them on leaves\r\nexcept on a Rugosa rose at Ithaca, New York.\r\nMildew is prevalent on soft succulent shoots, fostered by an excess of nitrogen.\r\nControl Sulfur dusts have been standard treatment for garden roses for many years; to be\r\neffective dusting must be started at the first sign\r\nof mildew, before the mycelium gets too thick.\r\nSulfur may be injurious to roses in very hot\r\nweather. Choice of variety of rose is important.\r\nShiny-leaved climbers like Dr. Van Fleet seldom\r\nhave mildew, and the shrub polyantha, The Fairy,\r\nis very resistant. Many red roses, hybrid teas and\r\nfluoribundas, are especially susceptible, but the\r\norange-red floribunda Spartan remains free from\r\nit (in my own experience). Garden planning\r\navoids a lot of mildew trouble. Keep the plants\r\nwell spaced, in beds away from buildings, and not\r\nsurrounded by tall hedges or walls.\r\nPodosphaera tridactyla Recently reported on\r\nalmond in California and the most common mildew on apricot, causing large nonnecrotic lesions\r\non leaves.\r\nSphaerotheca\r\nAppendages simple, flexuous, resembling\r\nhyphae; only 1 ascus in a perithecium.\r\nCystotheca lanestris (formerly Sphaerotheca\r\nlanestris). Powdery Mildew of coast live oak on\r\nQuercus agrifolia in California, reported also on\r\nwhite, southern red, bur and post oaks. The disease is most destructive in the narrow coastal\r\nplain. The most conspicuous symptom is\r\na powdery white, stunted growth developing\r\nfrom certain terminal or lateral buds. The shoots\r\nare swollen, fleshy, with much shortened internodes. Foliage on such shoots is often reduced to\r\npale yellow, bractlike leaves, which turn brown,\r\ndry, and shrivel; these shoots resembles witches\u2019\r\nbroom. On leaves developing from normal buds\r\nand shoots, the fungus forms a dense layer on\r\nboth surfaces, more abundant on the lower side.\r\nThis species is sometimes called the brown mildew because the grayish-white mycelium\r\nchanges to tan and then brown with age. Perithecia are formed in the brown felt, abundantly in\r\nsome years, rarely in others. In southern California the fungus may winter in the conidial state,\r\nwith widespread leaf and shoot infections coming\r\nfrom wind-borne spores.\r\nSphaerotheca 291"

Resistant varieties include Sparkle, Puget Beauty, Siletz and\r\nIndia.\r\nSphaerotheca mors-uvae American Gooseberry Mildew, also on currant; sometimes the\r\nlimiting factor in gooseberry production.

Conidia\r\nfor secondary infection are produced within 10\r\ndays. Spray with lime sulfur immediately after\r\nbloom.\r\nSphaerotheca pannosa var. persicae Peach\r\nMildew, general on peach, also on almond, apricot, nectarine, matrimony-vine, and Photinia.\r\nThe mycelium is pannose (ragged) or in dense\r\npatches, persistent, usually satiny, shining white,\r\nor sometimes grayish or brown. Immature fruits\r\nare highly susceptible. They have brown blotches\r\nand are scabby and malformed. The fungus winters in shoots. Nonglandular varieties Peak and\r\nPaloro are more affected than glandular Walton,\r\nJohnson, Halford, and Stuart, at least in California. Sulfur in the spray schedule for brown rot\r\nshould control mildew without additional treatments. Karathane is effective but very slightly\r\nphytotoxic.

The fungus is\r\nalso a weak parasite in roots of many nonlegumes. First described in 1925, the fungus probably existed earlier in various root disease\r\ncomplexes and was responsible for giving up\r\nland formerly devoted to canning peas. Considered the most important of the pea root rots, found\r\nin every district, it is particularly destructive in\r\neastern and central states.\r\nThe fungus is parasitic on subterranean parts,\r\ncausing root and stem rot in peas of all ages,\r\nsymptoms and crop yield varying with the time\r\nof infection. If the root system is invaded when\r\nonly three or four nodes are formed, the plant may\r\nwilt and die suddenly; later invasion results in\r\ndwarfing and drying out of foliage from the\r\nground upward. When seedlings are pulled out\r\nof the ground, the roots do not break off but come\r\nout as a fibrous string or vascular cylinder freed\r\nfrom cortex. The fungus invades only the cortex\r\nor roots and base of stem, causing softening and\r\nrapid decay of tissue. Large numbers of thickwalled oospores are formed in the cortex; these\r\nmay remain viable in the soil more than one\r\nseason.\r\nIt is a novel root pathogen on alfalfa in\r\nCanada.\r\nControl A well-drained soil with low moisture\r\ncontent decreases rot. When soil moisture is at\r\n45 % of saturation, there is no disease; at 75 %\r\nthere may be more than 70 % infection.

They are\r\nhoney-colored or light tan, with a stalk 4 to 6\r\ninches or more high and a cap 2 to 4 inches\r\nacross, often dotted with brown scales. Basidiospores formed along the gills are wind-borne.\r\nThey can establish themselves in old stumps and\r\ndead trees but cannot infect healthy trees. The\r\nlatter are infected in the ground by means of\r\nblack or brown cordlike rhizomorphs, the \u201cshoestrings,\u201d which grow out from infected roots\r\na short distance through the soil. On meeting\r\nand penetrating a healthy root, the fungus progresses along the cambium layer, working up to\r\nand girdling the root crown. Leaves are dwarfed,\r\nturn yellow or fall prematurely; on small trees all\r\nfoliage may die simultaneously. On conifers, particularly pines, there is an abnormal flow of resin\r\nfrom the root collar.\r\nTrees subnormal in vigor and suffering from\r\ndrought are most injured. Orchards of citrus\r\nand other fruits on lands recently cleared of\r\noaks are liable to enormous damage unless\r\nresistant rootstocks are used. The rot is found\r\nless often on dry hillsides than in valleys near\r\nstreambeds, where flood waters deposit soil\r\nand infected debris around root crowns, or in\r\nplaces kept too wet by artificial watering.\r\nOrnamental trees and shrubs are often injured\r\nwhen extra soil is added in grading and terracing, and are then kept too wet by watering the\r\nlawn frequently.\r\nThe list of susceptible plants is far too long to\r\nbe given in entirety. A representative selection\r\nincludes almond, apple, apricot, avocado, cherry,\r\ncitrus, currant, grape, incense cedar, peach, pear,\r\nplum and raspberry, hickory, filbert and walnut,\r\nCalifornia pepper-tree; oaks, pines, spruce and\r\nsycamore; azalea, rhododendron, boxwood and\r\nrose; (root, crown, and stem rot on) African\r\ndaisy and (stem rot on) sunflower; and sometimes\r\nother herbaceous plants such as begonia, carnation, dahlia, narcissus, peony, rhubarb, and\r\nstrawberry.\r\nFig. 1 Mushroom Root-Rot Fungus, Armillaria mellea\r\nArmillaria 297"

In\r\nstorage the rot is most active at room temperature\r\nor above.\r\nFusarium oxysporum f. sp. chrysanthemi -\r\nFusarium Wilt of chrysanthemum.\r\nFusarium oxysporum f. sp. gladioli (F.\r\northoceras var. gladioli). Fusarium Brown Rot,\r\nYellows of gladiolus, a major disease in some\r\nsections. Most infection takes place in the field,\r\nbut subsequent decay appears in storage. Corm\r\nlesions are first small, reddish brown, more often\r\non lower half of corm. They enlarge in storage to\r\nirregular to circular, sometimes zonate brown\r\nareas, which do not infrequently advance until\r\nthe whole corm is a hard, dry, brownish black\r\nmummy. Infection comes from old corms, the\r\nfungus penetrating through the basal plate and\r\nthe center of the new corm. The latter may be\r\nentirely decayed in storage, with the fungus\r\nadvancing from the center to the outside, causing\r\nbrown to black surface lesions.\r\nSymptoms of yellows, a vascular disease,\r\ninclude bending of young leaf stalks, cupping of\r\nleaf stalks in older plants, crooked flower stems,\r\noften greener than normal and a curving of\r\ngrowth away from the side of the corm showing\r\nrot. There is gradual yellowing and dying of\r\nfoliage, starting with the oldest leaves. Picardy\r\nand Spotlight varieties are particularly susceptible. Nitrogenous fertilizers and manures, especially where phosphorus is low, increase corm\r\nrot.\r\nControl Cure immediately after digging at 95 \u0003F\r\nto develop wound periderm and cuticle resistant\r\nto the fungus; use resistant varieties where possible or a 3-to 4-year rotation.\r\nFusarium oxysporum f. sp. lilii. Basal Rot of\r\nlily, on bulbs, roots, stems of garden and native\r\nlilies; Corm Rot of crocus, also on freesia and\r\ncactus (Cereus). A chocolate rot at base of scales\r\nnext to the basal plate progresses until the scales\r\nfall away. The disease is more destructive to\r\nMadonna and some other garden lilies; it is seldom a problem with Easter lilies grown in the\r\nNorthwest. Keep bulbs cool in storage, and plant\r\nin cool soil. Infection comes from contaminated\r\nsoil as well as diseased bulbs.\r\nFusarium oxysporum f. sp. narcissi (F.\r\nbulbigenum). Narcissus Basal Rot, general on\r\nhardy varieties, rare on polyanthus varieties.

The\r\nrot starts as a small, circular brown spot but\r\nspreads rapidly to take in the entire fruit, with\r\nthe rotted surface covered with gray to light\r\nbrown spore tufts or cushions (sporodochia),\r\nsometimes in concentric rings (see Fig. 5).\r\nConidia are formed in chains on the sporodochia.\r\nThe fruit finally shrinks and mummifies and\r\neither falls to the ground or remains clinging to\r\nthe tree.\r\nThe fungus and decayed tissue together\r\nform a stroma that acts as a sclerotium; in\r\nspring, if the mummy has been kept moist\r\nand partially or wholly covered with soil,\r\ncup-shaped brown apothecia are produced. Primary infection is from ascospores, forcibly\r\nejected and carried up to blossoms by air currents or from a new crop of conidia formed on\r\nmummies hanging on trees. Secondary infection is from conidia wind-borne from blossom\r\nto blossom and later from fruit to fruit.\r\nMonilinia 317"

        "html": "Entrance is often through wounds made by the\r\nplum curculio, oriental fruit moth and other\r\ninsects. Rotting and conidial production continue after picking.\r\nThe rot is favored by wet weather, conidia\r\ngerminating only in a film of water. Acid soil is\r\nsaid to increase apothecial production from\r\nmummies on the ground. In a normal season\r\nreduction from blossom blight is not important\r\nbecause some thinning is advantageous; but if\r\nblossom blight is not prevented, inoculum is provided for the fruit rot that causes such enormous\r\nlosses.\r\nControl Sanitary measures are important. In\r\nthe small garden rake up and burn or bury\r\ndeeply the fallen mummies; pick mummies\r\nfrom trees; cut out twigs showing gum; in\r\nsummer remove infected fruit before conidia\r\nform. Standard control has been wettable sulfur sprays or sulfur dust, applied: every 3 or\r\n4 days during bloom to control blossom blight;\r\nwhen shucks are falling; 2 or 3 weeks after\r\nshuck fall; and 2 to 4 weeks before fruit ripens.\r\nIn some instances the newer organic fungicides\r\nare preferred to sulfur, and sometimes they are\r\nused with it. Control of the plum curculio is\r\nvery important.

Although this\r\ndisease is similar to that caused by M. fructicola,\r\nthe blossom and twig blight phase is more important than the brown rot. Sulfur, which can be used\r\nin later sprays for most stone fruits, may injure\r\napricots.\r\nMonilinia oxycocci (Syn. Sclerotinia oxycocci).\r\nCranberry Hard Rot, Tip Blight in Pacific Northwest and Wisconsin. Young growing tips wilt\r\nand dry just before blossoming; grayish spores\r\ntufts are formed on tips.

The\r\nsterile state of this fungus, Rhizoctonia solani,\r\nwas first named in 1858 in a German textbook\r\nand is still the most familiar term for a fungus\r\nwith many pathogenic strains causing many types\r\nof diseases.\r\nAny cook has seen signs of the pathogen on\r\npotato tubers \u2013 small brown to black hard\r\nflecks, sclerotia, on the skin. They look like\r\nparticles of dirt but do not scrub off when\r\npotatoes are washed. There may be only one\r\nor two sclerotia, or they may nearly cover the\r\nwhole surface of the tuber. When such potatoes\r\nare planted, the growing point may be killed.\r\nSome sprouts renew growth after being girdled, which may be repeated until they die.\r\nLarger plants have stems decayed just\r\nbelow the soil line, interrupting the downward\r\ntransfer of food and resulting in a cluster of\r\ngreen or reddish aerial tubers. Roots may be\r\nkilled back extensively. Most of the tubers\r\nare small, often with a brown jelly rot at the\r\nstem end.\r\nUnder moist conditions a white cobwebby\r\nweft of mycelium is formed at the base of\r\npotato stems, and the basidial stage is produced as a powdery crust on this weft. The\r\nfungus winters as mycelium or sclerotia in\r\nsoil or tubers. The mycelium can grow saprophytically long distances in the soil independent of any plant. Infection is favored by cool\r\ntemperatures; the disease is most serious in\r\nwet seasons on heavy soils.

If plants next to the wilted\r\nones are pulled out, these apparently healthy\r\nplants will often be found to be covered with\r\nyellow to buff mats of mycelium, and under\r\nmoist conditions spore mats appear on the surface\r\nof the soil around diseased plants. Such mats are 2\r\nto 12 inches in diameter, first snow white and\r\ncottony, later tan and powdery from spores produced in quantities. The fungus spreads through\r\nthe soil by means of rhizomorphs, smooth, dark\r\nbrown strands. The rate of spread may be 2 to\r\n8 feet a month in an alfalfa field, 5 to 30 feet\r\na season in a cotton field, or around fruit trees.\r\nSclerotia are formed along the mycelial\r\nstrands. They are small, roundish, light at first,\r\nthen dark and warty. The fungus winters either as\r\nsclerotia in soil, persisting several years in the\r\nabsence of live hosts, or as dormant mycelium in\r\nliving roots. The disease is most common and\r\nsevere on heavy, alkaline soils. Abundant organic\r\nmaterial reduces rot by favoring antagonistic soil\r\nsaprophytes.\r\nControl In ornamental plantings replace diseased plants with some of those given in the\r\nresistant list. Monocotyledons are generally resistant. In locating new orchards, make sure that\r\nroot rot has not been present previously by growing an indicator crop of cotton for a year. Grow\r\nimmune crops in rotation with susceptible crops,\r\nand grow susceptible annuals in winter rather\r\nthan summer. Try heavy manuring.\r\nAmmonium sulfate can sometimes save\r\na valuable ornamental tree or shrubs already\r\ninfected with root rot. Prune back the top, make\r\na circular ridge about the plant at the edge of the\r\nbranch spread, and work ammonium sulfate into\r\nthe soil within the ridge then fill the basin with\r\nwater to a depth of 4 inches. The chemical treatment and watering is repeated in 5 to 10 days,\r\n324 Rots"

In conifers root rot is dry with\r\nresin flow; needles gradually lose color. Infected\r\ntissue of hardwoods turns reddish brown except\r\nin black walnut, where it is black; seedlings die.\r\nThe disease is aggravated in pine by poor aeration\r\nand low fertility.\r\nRoot rot is the most serious avocado disease in\r\nCalifornia, present also in Florida and Texas. It\r\noccurs on soils with poor drainage, excess moisture being necessary. As the roots rot, leaves\r\nbecome light-colored and wilt even if soil is\r\nmoist; trees decline over a period of years.

A strain of this pathogen causes root\r\nrot of loganberry. The fungus attacks roots only,\r\ndestroying fine feeding roots first, then invading\r\nthe central cylinder, stele, which turns dark red.\r\nNew spring leaves on badly affected plants are\r\nsmall, bluish, have short petioles; large leaves\r\nfrom the previous season dry up; little or no\r\nfruit is produced; plants die in the first dry period\r\nor are stunted.\r\nThe fungus is most active in cold, wet soil, in\r\nrainy periods in late fall, winter, and early spring\r\nexcept when ground is frozen. Zoospores produced on roots are spread by water; resting spores\r\nformed in the red stele carry the pathogen in\r\na dormant state through the heat of summer.\r\nThere are at least three physiological races, and\r\nonce the fungus infests a field it is worthless for\r\nstrawberries for 10 years.\r\nControl Buy clean, certified plants.

It is\r\nfound on juniper and azalea in North Carolina. It\r\nis also reported on mountain-laurel and Photinia\r\nin NC and on cypress from Washington and\r\napparently native to the Northwest. The fungus\r\nenters through the roots and spreads to lower part\r\nof main trunk killing the tissues. Blue cypress\r\nchanges to purple, green, finally tan and dies.\r\nThe color changes take several months in cool,\r\ndamp weather, only 2 or 3 weeks in hot, dry\r\nweather. There is no practical chemical control,\r\nand Lawson cypress seems to be incompatible\r\nwith resistant rootstocks. Grow disease-free\r\npropagating stock in new soil. Avoid large plantings of Lawson cypress such as windbreaks or\r\nhedges. Remove and destroy infected plants, getting the entire root system.\r\nPhytophthora megasperma Root Rot, occasional on cabbage, cauliflower, brussel sprouts,\r\ncarrot, artichoke, stock, citrus, soybean and wallflower. Diseased plants wilt suddenly; leaves turn\r\nred to purple; underground stems and roots rot.\r\nThe disease is more prevalent in winter plantings\r\nin California and in low, poorly drained areas.\r\nLevel ground properly before planting to avoid\r\nwaterlogged spots.

Actinomyces\r\nipomoea) Soil Rot or Pox of sweet potatoes, general New Jersey to Florida and in the Southwest.\r\nThis pathogen also infects Jacquemontia. Leaves\r\nare small, pale green to yellow; plants are\r\ndwarfed, make little or no vine growth, and may\r\ndie before end of the season; the root system is\r\npoorly developed with most roots rotted off, or\r\nbreaking off if plant is pulled from the soil. Small\r\ndark lesions are formed on stems below the soil\r\nline. Pits with jagged or roughened margins, often\r\ncoalescing, are formed on mature roots. The rot is\r\nfound in soils at pH 5.2 or above; and is worse in\r\ndry soils and seasons.

Lesions on corms start as\r\nreddish specks, with slightly elevated darker border; spots enlarge, and centers become sunken,\r\ndark brown to black with lighter raised edges;\r\nthey grow together into irregular areas. On\r\nhusks the lesions are tobacco brown. Very small\r\nblack sclerotia are formed on husks, in corm\r\nlesions, and on dead stems. Plants in the field\r\nturn yellow and die prematurely owing to decay\r\nof leaf sheath. Corms may appear normal when\r\ndug, the rot developing in storage. The disease is\r\nmore prevalent in heavy soils, and the fungus can\r\nsurvive several years in soil. Apothecia have been\r\nproduced artificially by fertilizing receptive bodies on sclerotia with spermatia (microconidia).\r\nStromatinia 337"

        "html": "Rusts\r\nRust fungi belong to the Uredinales, a highly\r\nspecialized order of the Basidiomycetes. In common with mushrooms they have spores of the\r\nsexual stage borne in fours on a club-shaped\r\nhypha known as a basidium, but apart from this\r\nthey differ very decidedly from woody and fleshy\r\nBasidiomycetes. The term rust is applied both to\r\nthe pathogen and to the disease it inflicts. There\r\nare more than 4000 species of rusts, all obligate\r\nparasites on ferns or seed plants. Many are heteroecious, completing their life cycle on two different kinds of plants; but some are autoecious\r\n(monoecious), having all spore forms on a single\r\nhost species. There are only two families,\r\nMelampsoraceae and Pucciniaceae.\r\nMany rusts show physiological specialization,\r\nthe existence within a species of numerous strains\r\nor races that look alike but attack different varieties of crop plants, thus greatly complicating the\r\nproblem of breeding for rust resistance. Rusts\r\nwith a complete life cycle have five different\r\nspore forms, numbered 0 to IV.\r\n0. Pycniospores (spermatia) formed in pycnia\r\n(spermagonia). The pycnia resemble pycnidia\r\nof Ascomycetes, are usually on upperside of\r\nleaves. They discharge one-celled\r\npycniospores with drops of nectar, and these,\r\nusually distributed by insects attracted to the\r\nsweet secretion, function in fertilization.\r\nI. Aeciospores (aecidiospores), one-celled,\r\norange or yellow, formed, often in chains,\r\nin a cuplike sorus or aecium, which has\r\na peridium (wall) opening at or beyond the\r\nsurface of the host.\r\nII. Urediospores (uredospores, summer spores,\r\nred rust spores), one-celled, walls spiny or\r\nwarty, reddish brown, on stalks or in chains\r\nin a uredium (uredinium or uredosorus), over\r\nwhich the epidermis of the host is broken to\r\nfree the spores. Resting II spores, formed by\r\nsome rusts, have thicker and darker walls.\r\nIII. Teliospores (teleutospores, winter spores,\r\nblack rust spores), one or more cells, in\r\ntelia (teleuto sori), either on stalks, as in the\r\nfamily Pucciniaceae, or sessile, in crusts or\r\ncushions as in the Melampsoraceae.\r\nIV. Basidiospores (sporidia) on a basidium or\r\npromycelium formed by the germinating\r\nteliospore. Basidium is usually divided transversely into four cells, with one sporidium\r\nformed from each cell at the tip of a sterigma.\r\nIn heteroecious rusts spore stages 0 and I are\r\nformed on one host and II and III on another, and\r\nare so indicated in the information given with\r\neach species. Stage IV always follows III on\r\ngermination. Although most autoecious rusts\r\nhave all spore forms, on one host, there are\r\na few short-cycle (microcylic) rusts with some\r\nspore stages dropped out. For a detailed life history of a heteroecious rust, \u25b6Puccinia graminis.\r\nGardeners frequently mistake a reddish discoloration of a leaf, perhaps due to spray injury or\r\nweather or a leaf-spot fungus, for rust. True rust is\r\nidentified by the presence of rust-colored spores in\r\npowdery pustules or perhaps gelatinous horns.\r\nWith rusts, the discoloration of tissue is yellowish,\r\nnot red, and it is due to increased evaporation from\r\nthe broken epidermis. Plants are often stunted.\r\nR.K. Horst, Westcott\u2019s Plant Disease Handbook, DOI 10.1007/978-94-007-2141-8_42,\r\n# Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013\r\n341"

        "html": "gooseberry. Occurs also on limber pine in\r\nNorthcentral and Southeastern Wyoming.\r\nThis dread disease is supposed to have originated in Asia, whence it spread to Europe, where\r\nthe eastern white pine introduced from America\r\nwas very susceptible. White pine blister rust was\r\nfound in Russia in 1854, and by 1900 had spread\r\nover most of Europe. It was recorded on Ribes at\r\nGeneva, New York, in 1906, but probably was\r\nthere some years previously. In 1909 it was found\r\non pine, at which time it was learned that infected\r\npines from a German nursery had been widely\r\nplanted throughout the Northeast. The next year\r\nthe disease reached Vancouver, British Columbia, in a shipment from a French nursery, whence\r\nit spread to Washington, Oregon, Northern California, Idaho, and western Montana. Thus from\r\ncheap stock brought in for forest planting has\r\ncome one of our greatest forest hazards. Our\r\npresent quarantine laws are designed to prevent\r\nsuch introductions.\r\nThe western white sugar and whitebark pines\r\nare even more susceptible to blister rust than\r\neastern white pine; but in either case robust,\r\ndominant trees are more severely attacked, with\r\nfrail individuals lightly infected. This however, is\r\npartly explained by more vigorous trees having\r\nmore needles to receive spores. Of the Ribes\r\nspecies, black currant is most susceptible and\r\ndangerous. Cultivated red currants are somewhat\r\nresistant, causing a minimum of pine infection;\r\nViking and Red Dutch varieties are practically\r\nimmune. Wild gooseberries and skunk currant\r\nare highly susceptible in the Northeast, as are\r\nwestern black currant, stink currant, and red\r\nflowering currant. The greater the susceptibility\r\nof the Ribes species, the more spores are produced to inoculate pines, with proportionate\r\ndamage.\r\nSymptoms and Life History When a spore arrives\r\non a pine needle from a currant, the first sign of\r\ninfection is a small golden yellow to reddish\r\nbrown spot. The next season, or possibly in two\r\nyears, the bark looks yellowish, often with an\r\norange tinge to the margin of the discolored\r\narea, and there may be a spindle-shaped swelling.\r\nIf such symptoms appear early in the season,\r\npycnia are formed in bark by July or August;\r\nbut if discoloration is delayed until midsummer,\r\nthey appear the next year. The male fruiting bodies are small, honey yellow to brown patches,\r\nswelling to shallow blisters and rupturing to discharge drops of a yellowish, sweet liquid. After\r\nthis is eaten by insects or washed away by rain,\r\nthe lesions turn dark. The next spring or summer\r\naecia push through the bark in the same region.\r\nThese are white blisters, rupturing to free orangeyellow aeciospores, which are carried away by\r\nwind. The bark then dries out and cracks, with\r\ndeath of cambium and underlying wood. The\r\ndisease has taken 3 to 6 years to reach this stage.\r\nProduction of aecia continues yearly until\r\nstem is killed beyond the lesion. Dead foliage\r\nassumes a conspicuous red-brown color. This\r\n\u201cflag\u201d of brown on a green background is the\r\nmost conspicuous symptom of blister rust before\r\ndeath of the pine. Infection progresses downward\r\nfrom small to larger branches and into trunk.\r\nSwellings are not apparent on stems much over\r\n2 inches in diameter on eastern white pine, but\r\nin the West they sometimes show up in stems\r\n5 inches through. Larger limbs and trunks sometimes show constriction in the girdled area.\r\nThe aeciospores, large, ellipsoidal, with thick,\r\nwarty walls, are carried by wind great distances to\r\nRibes species (they cannot reinfect pine). They\r\nsend their germ tubes into a currant or gooseberry\r\nleaf through stomata, and within 1 to 3 weeks\r\npinhead-size blisters appear in clusters on\r\nyellowed leaf tissue. These uredia rupture to\r\nrelease large, ellipsoidal, yellow urediospores\r\nwith thick, colorless walls and short, sharp but\r\nsparse spines. The spores are somewhat moist and\r\nsticky, and are windborne short distances to other\r\nRibes bushes nearby. There may be up to seven\r\ngenerations in a summer, or the spores may\r\nremain viable over winter in uredia; this stage\r\ncan infect only currant.\r\nIn late summer telia follow uredia in the same\r\nor new leaf lesions, appearing as short brown\r\nbristles on underside of leaves or looking like\r\na coarse felt. Each felty bristle is composed of\r\nvertical rows of broad, spindle-shaped spores,\r\nwhich germinate in situ to a five-celled\r\npromycelium with each of the four upper\r\ncells bearing at the point of a sterigma a small,\r\n346 Rusts"

The spores from pine to\r\ncurrant can be carried many miles, up to 300.\r\nBlister rust is more important at elevations of\r\n1000 feet or over, where it is increased by lower\r\ntemperatures and more rainfall.\r\nControl Eradication of the Ribes host is definitely effective in controlling white pine blister\r\nrust. This means complete removal of black currants and local removal of cultivated red and wild\r\ncurrants and gooseberries within 300 or 900 feet\r\nof pines, according to state regulations, taking\r\ncare to get all the root system capable of\r\nresprouting.\r\nBlister rust is seldom found on ornamental\r\npines in cities; the smoke and fumes are unfavorable to the fungus.

It is more important commercially in\r\nthe apple-growing regions of the Virginias and\r\nCarolinas and certain states in the Mississippi\r\nValley. It is important in many areas on ornamental crabapples in home plantings.\r\nThe cedar \u201capples\u201d or galls vary from 1/16\r\ninch to over 2 inches across. Leaves are infected\r\nduring the summer, and by the next June a small,\r\ngreenish brown swelling appears on upper or\r\ninner leaf surface. This enlarges until by autumn\r\nthe leaf has turned into a chocolate brown, somewhat kidney-shaped gall covered with small circular depressions. The next spring in moist\r\nweather orange telial horns are put forth from\r\nthe pocketlike depressions. The teliospores are\r\nenveloped in a gelatinous material that swells\r\nvastly, a gall covered with horns sometimes\r\nreaching the size of a small orange. They germinate in place to produce the basidiospores, which\r\nare carried by wind to infect apple or other deciduous host.\r\nBy midsummer, apple leaves show yellow\r\nareas with amber pustules on upper surface; but\r\nafter pycnia have exuded drops of sticky liquid,\r\nthey appear as black dots in a rather reddish\r\ncircle. On the undersurface of these spots small\r\ncups are formed, with recurved fimbriate margins. These aecia may also appear near stem end\r\nof apples and are common on swollen twigs of\r\ncrabapple. Spores from these cups are blown\r\nback to the cedar in late summer, the entire\r\ncycle thus taking 2 years, 18 to 20 months on\r\nthe cedar, 4 to 6 on the apple host.\r\nChief injury is to the apple host, the rust causing premature defoliation, dwarfing and poorquality fruit. On very susceptible crabapples,\r\nsuch as Bechtel\u2019s crab, repeated infection may\r\ncause death of the branches or of the entire tree.\r\nAll our native crabapples are susceptible; most\r\nAsiatic varieties are resistant.\r\nControl Care in planning is most important.\r\nDon\u2019t let your landscape architect or gardener\r\nput cedars and native crabapples or hawthorns\r\nclose together.

Proof of the connection between barberry and wheat in the life cycle was not made\r\nuntil 1864, but long before that farmers\r\nhad noticed that wheat suffered when barberry\r\nplants were near. France in 1660, Connecticut in\r\n1726, and Massachusetts in 1755 enacted\r\nlaws requiring the destruction of barberry near\r\ngrain fields.\r\nThere are six commonly recognized varieties\r\nof stem rust: Puccinia graminis f. sp. avenae\u2013on\r\noats, sweet vernal grass, brome grasses, some\r\nfescues.\r\nP. graminis f. sp. agrostidis\u2013on redtop and\r\nother Agrostis spp.\r\nP. graminis f. sp. graminicola\u2014on St. Augustine grass.\r\nP. graminis f. sp. phlei-pratensis\u2013on timothy\r\nand some related grasses.\r\nP. graminis f. sp. poae\u2013on Kentucky and other\r\nbluegrasses.\r\nP. graminis f. sp. secalis\u2013on rye, some wheat,\r\nand barley grasses.\r\nP. graminis f. sp. tritici, wheat rust \u2013 on wheat,\r\nbarley, rye, and many grasses.\r\nStem rust occurs wherever wheat is grown, but\r\nis most serious in northern states. It is dependent\r\non weather conditions, with epidemics and disastrous losses in certain seasons. The amount\r\ndepends on the maturity of the crop when rust\r\nstrikes, but losses may run 25 % of expected yield\r\nfor the nation and much higher for individual\r\nstates. There are a great many physiological\r\nraces.\r\nOn grains and grasses the first rust appears as\r\nlong, narrow streaks on stems, leaf sheaths, leaf\r\nbases, and distal portions of blades. These streaks\r\nare uredial sori, the epidermis being torn back to\r\nform a white collar around a dark red powdery\r\nmass of one-celled urediospores. Later the same\r\nsori turn black as dark, two-celled teliospores\r\nreplace summer urediospores. Stems may be broken at this stage.\r\nPuccinia 357"

        "html": "The summer spores appear about 10 days after\r\ninfection. This stage can be repeated, the spores\r\nreinfecting wheat, and, since they are carried by\r\nwind from one plant to another, one state to\r\nanother, even to hundreds of miles, they account\r\nfor large outbreaks of disease. In Mexico and\r\nsouthern Texas this II stage continues through\r\nthe winter and causes spring infection without\r\nthe intervention of barberry. Waves of urediospores coming up from the South may start northern infection.\r\nNormally in the North, spring infection starts\r\non barberry from sporidia (basidiospores) produced on a promycelium put forth by\r\na teliospore wintered on a wheat stem. Two\r\nsexes occur in this rust,\r\ndesignated + and \u2013 rather than male and female.\r\nA young teliospore contains two nuclei, one +\r\nand the other \u2013; as the spore matures, these fuse to\r\na single nucleus, which divides twice in the production of the four-celled basidium\r\n(promycelium). Each cell produces a sporidium;\r\ntwo of these are + and two \u2013. A sporidium falling\r\non a barberry leaf germinates, sends in an infection thread, and develops a mononucleate (haploid) feeding mycelium and finally a flask-shaped\r\npycnium containing pycniospores, which correspond to the sex of the sporidium starting infection. The pycnia are in reddish lesions on the\r\nupper leaf surface. Hyphal threads, receptive\r\nhyphae, extend through the mouth of the\r\npycnium. Aided by insects, which are attracted\r\nby a sweet nectar, pycniospores (spermatia) of\r\none sex are brought into contact with receptive\r\nhyphae of the opposite sex, and sexual union\r\ntakes place, without which there is no further\r\ndevelopment of the rust.\r\nThe dicaryotic or binucleate mycelium formed\r\nfrom the fertilized hypha grows through the cells\r\nof the barberry leaf and masses together on the\r\nunderside to produce aecia filled with a yellowish\r\nwaxy layer of aeciospores in cluster-cup formation. These spores, unable to reinfect barberry or\r\nmahonia are wind-borne to the cereal or grass\r\nhost, the subsequent mycelium continuing binucleate until the fusion in the teliospore. New\r\ncrops of urediospores can be produced every 10\r\nto 14 days.\r\nControl Resistant varieties are of primary\r\nimportance, but they are difficult to maintain\r\nbecause the sexual process in rusts allows the\r\ncontinuous development of new strains.\r\nMore than 200 strains are known, but only\r\na dozen or so are important in any one year.\r\nRace 15B is prevalent most years and can attack\r\nall varieties of wheat grown in this country. Eradication of the barberry eliminates the alternate\r\nhost and also the breeding place of new rust\r\nvarieties. Most barberry and mahonia species\r\nare under quarantine, but some have been designated rust-resistant by the U.S. Department\r\nof Agriculture and may be shipped interstate\r\nunder permit.\r\nPuccinia helianthi Sunflower Rust. 0, I, II, III\r\ngeneral on sunflower, Jerusalem artichoke, and\r\nheliopsis.

The form on cherry and European plum has been attributed to Venturia\r\ncerasae (Cladosporium cerasi). Small, round,\r\nolive black spots appear on infected fruits about\r\n6 weeks after petals have fallen. These are usually\r\non upperside of fruit, and cracking may follow.\r\nTwigs show nearly circular yellow-brown\r\nblotches with gray or bluish borders; cambium\r\nmay be killed and twig die. Leaf spots are brown,\r\nscattered, with tissue drying and falling out, leaving circular holes.\r\nControl The brown-rot spray schedule should\r\nalso control scab, a sulfur spray 4 to 6 weeks\r\nafter petal fall being especially important.\r\nA fungicide can be combined with an insecticide\r\nspray for curculio.\r\nCladosporium caryigenum Pecan Scab, Leaf\r\nSpot, general on pecan, and hickory.

Crop\r\nlosses may reach 75 to 95 %.\r\nThe fungus attacks rapidly growing tissue in\r\nleaves, shoots, and nuts; mature growth seems to\r\nbe immune. On Schley and other highly susceptible varieties, primary infection shows in elongated olive brown lesions on veins and underside\r\nof leaves. With secondary infection leaves appear\r\nalmost black, as a result of coalescing of spots;\r\ndefoliation follows. On more resistant varieties,\r\nsuch as Moore and Stuart, infection is of ten\r\ndelayed until the leaves are nearly mature, and\r\nso scab spots are confined to nuts. Nut lesions are\r\nsmall, black, circular, slightly raised at first, then\r\nsunken. Spots may be so close together that the\r\nentire surface turns black; the nuts drop prematurely or remain attached to shoots indefinitely.\r\nInfection is correlated with spring and early summer rainfall, continuous moisture for 6 to 8 hours\r\nbeing required for the spores to germinate and\r\nenter the host.

Indigenous to\r\nSouth America and introduced into Europe\r\nmore than a century ago, potato scab was not\r\nnoticed in North America before 1913, in\r\nMaine. Ordinarily not important, it causes economic loss in some seasons. Slightly raised pimples appear on tubers when they are less than an\r\ninch in diameter; they are varying shades of\r\nbrown on the surface, faintly purple underneath.\r\nThe epidermis, not growing as fast as the pimple,\r\nbreaks and curls back over the pustule, which, by\r\nthis time, is a brown powdery mass of spore balls\r\nand decomposed plant tissue. The lesions are\r\noften \u201ccorked off,\u201d but under favorable conditions large, depressed cankers may form. The\r\nfungus winters on stored tubers or in soil,\r\nremaining viable for many years. In the presence\r\nof a potato tuber and enough moisture, each\r\nspore in the ball germinates by swarmspores,\r\nwhich stay grouped together in a plasmodium,\r\ndissolving cuticle and killing cells. When the\r\nfood supply diminishes, the plasmodium again\r\nbreaks up into spore balls.\r\nControl Avoid low soggy ground; if such soil\r\nmust be used, acidify it with sulfur as for common\r\nscab.\r\nStreptomyces\r\n\u25b6 Rots.\r\nStreptomyces acidiscabies Acid Scab on beet,\r\ncarrot, radish, parsley and turnip.\r\nStreptomyces scabies (Syn.

This disease\r\nmay have been in America as long as potatoes\r\nhave been grown, but the causal organism was\r\nnot described until 1890. Scabby potatoes, by\r\nlowering the market grade, mean an annual loss\r\nof several million dollars. Chief symptoms are\r\nthe tuber lesions, starting as minute brown specks\r\nand progressing to scabs that are warty or with\r\ncorky ridges, or are pitted and depressed with the\r\nskin cracking open. Such potatoes can be eaten,\r\nbut have poor customer appeal and are wasteful\r\nbecause of the deep peeling required. On beets,\r\nthe scabs are similar but more bulging. The pathogen can be found even in virgin soil. It invades\r\nyoung tubers and may sometimes be seen as\r\na grayish coating on freshly dug potatoes. It is\r\nmost destructive in soils with pH 5.7 and over,\r\nwith its activity sharply limited in soils slightly\r\nmore acid. Although its optimum temperature is\r\n72\u0001 to 86 \u0001F, the fungus can withstand great\r\nextremes of temperature and moisture and can\r\npass through the digestive tract of animals,\r\nreturning to the field in manure.\r\nControl Seed tubers have been treated with formalin, but the organism is so prevalent in potato\r\nsoils that such treatment may have little result.\r\nSoils already slightly acid may be further acidified with sulfur.

Sometimes the leaf is\r\nraised or domed in the vicinity of the spot;\r\nsometimes it turns brown and drops prematurely. Similar spots may be formed on blossom\r\npedicel, calyx, and petals, followed by dropping\r\nof young fruit. Scabby lesions sometimes appear\r\non twigs, but are less common. On fruits, spots\r\nare small, more or less raised, rounded, dark\r\nolive areas (see Fig. 1). As they increase in\r\nsize, the cuticle ruptures to form a white rim\r\naround a dark, velvety center, and still later the\r\ncenter may be raised, corky, and tan in color,\r\nafter dark mycelium and spores have\r\ndisappeared. Lesions are usually most abundant\r\nnear calyx end of fruit; if they are too numerous,\r\nthe fruit splits.\r\nLife History The fungus winters in dead fallen\r\nleaves, producing small, dark, flask-shaped perithecia and, toward spring, asci with eight brown\r\nascospores, unequally two-celled, with the upper\r\ncell wider than the lower (Fig. 2).

Like\r\nthe rusts, they belong to the Basidiomycetes and\r\nare all plant parasites, of most economic importance on cereals and grasses, but they differ from\r\nrusts in having a less complicated life history and\r\nin being able to live part of their lives saprophytically in rich organic matter or in culture media.\r\nThere are two spore forms. The teliospore,\r\nusually called a chlamydospore, is formed by\r\nthe rounding up of a hyphal cell. In addition to a\r\nthin inner endospore wall, it has a thick outer\r\nexospore wall, usually dark, smooth or ornamental. Teliospores are formed singly or united into\r\nballs. They can be distributed long distances by\r\nwind, and spores of some species remain viable\r\nfor years. Some have to ripen several months\r\nbefore they can germinate.\r\nOccasionally the teliospore puts out a germ\r\ntube that penetrates host tissue directly. More\r\noften it produces a promycelium that gives rise\r\nto sporidia, which can bud to more sporidia.\r\nClassically true smuts have been divided into\r\ntwo families on the type of sporidial formation:\r\nUstilaginaceae, with sporidia produced on the\r\nsides of a four-celled promycelium, and\r\nTilletiaceae, with sporidia produced at the end\r\nof a one-or two-celled promycelium. Fischer,\r\nhowever, points out that there are so many variations that it is preferable to include all species in\r\na single family, Ustilaginaceae, and to differentiate the species on the basis of morphological\r\ncharacters and the host family. This is logical,\r\nbut we include here the families as they are\r\ngiven in most textbooks and also the false\r\nsmuts, Graphiolaceae (Ustilaginales), which\r\nhave an uncertain taxonomic position.\r\nThere are three types of infection with smuts,\r\nwith control measures modified according to\r\ntype. The mycelium always penetrates the\r\nyoung host tissue directly; it does not enter\r\nthrough stomata.\r\n1. Infection of seedlings as the seed germinates,\r\nfrom spores adhering to the outside of the\r\nseed or present in soil; controlled by dusting\r\nseed and planting in noninfested soil.\r\n2. Seedling infection by mycelium within the\r\nseed as a result of ovary infection from spores\r\ngerminating on the stigma; controlled by\r\ntreating seed with hot water.\r\n3. Infection of any actively growing meristematic tissue (roots, shoot, tassels, or young\r\nears) by spores transported by wind\r\nfrom decaying plant material; controlled,\r\npartially, by spraying or dusting susceptible\r\nplants.\r\nBurrillia\r\nTilletiaceae.

The\r\nspore is able to penetrate the onion through root\r\nand cotyledon but cannot enter a true leaf.

The fungus\r\nwas described in Europe in 1754 and not reported\r\nhere before 1822, but it may be native along with\r\nits host.

Later the membrane breaks and releases\r\nmyriads of dark chlamydospores. The plant\r\nis often distorted. Infections are local; each boil\r\nis formed where a spore lands, and there is\r\nno systemic growth through the plant. The fungus\r\nis not seed-borne, and germinating seedlings\r\nare not affected. Chlamydospores winter in soil,\r\ncorn debris, and manure. They produce sporidia,\r\nwhich may bud to form secondary sporidia,\r\nand these are carried by wind and other agencies\r\nto corn plants, which are 1 to 3 feet high.\r\nMycelium from spores of two sexes is needed\r\nfor active development.

Heaviest infection occurs when scant rainfall in early stages of growth is followed by\r\nmoderate rainfall as corn approaches maturity.\r\nVigorous plants are most susceptible, but may\r\nescape the most serious effects because of their\r\nrapid growth.

A black velvety\r\nmembranous coating is formed over leaves,\r\ntwigs, and fruit.

The black membrane is made up of hyphae that are individually\r\nolive green to deep brown, with wide short cells.\r\nBranches may crisscross or be cemented\r\ntogether. There are several spore forms: simple\r\nconidia that are cut off from upright hyphae,\r\nothers formed in small, black pycnidia,\r\nstylospores in very long flask-shaped conceptacles, and muriform brown ascospores in\r\nperithecia.\r\nAlthough sooty molds do not obtain food from\r\nthe plant, the black membrane interferes greatly\r\nwith photosynthesis and food manufacture.\r\nAffected fruit is smaller, with coloring retarded;\r\nit is more likely to decay than normal fruit.\r\nControl is directed against the insects, either\r\nby spraying with insecticides or by using\r\nentomogenous fungi and insect parasites.

It was first recorded there in 1885;\r\nthe fungus was identified as a Sphaceloma\r\nin 1925.\r\nTender growth is most readily infected, and\r\nthe disease is most important on young trees. On\r\nleaves, minute, semitranslucent spots change to\r\nraised excrescences with corky crests, pale yellow to pinkish, then dull olive drab with a conical\r\ndepression opposite the crust. Foliage may be\r\nwrinkled or stunted. Fruits have slightly raised\r\nscabs or are warty with corky crests, which may\r\ngrow together into large irregular patches. Scabs\r\non grapefruit may flake off as the fruit matures,\r\nwith the area remaining green. Spores are spread\r\nby wind, rain, dew-drip, possibly by insects. The\r\nyoung fruit of grapefruit is very susceptible right\r\nafter petal fall, but becomes progressively resistant and is practically immune when it reaches\r\n3/4 inch in diameter. Temperature range for\r\nsevere infection is from 59\u0001 to 73 \u0001F. Excessive\r\nnitrogen increases scab. The pathogen winters on\r\ninfected leaves, sometimes fruits.\r\nControl Apply a neutral copper spray or\r\nbordeaux mixture just before growth starts in\r\nspring. A second copper spray, just after flowers\r\nshed, controls melanose as well as scab.\r\nElsinoe\u00a8 ilicis Chinese Holly Spot Anthracnose.\r\nNumerous black spots, 1 to 2 mm, coalesce to\r\nlarge black patches on upperside of leaf mostly\r\nthe apical half, with distortion.

Fortunately recent biochemical and molecular investigations on organization and structure of genome as well as on\r\nstructural and nonstructural viral proteins provided enough data to create a definition of species. A virus species is a polythetical class of\r\nviruses consisting of replicating lineage and\r\noccupying a particular ecological niche. This\r\nindicated that viruses and biological entities that\r\npossess genes, replicate, interact with hosts and\r\nare exposed to selection pressure, thus specialize\r\nand evolve. Guidelines provided in the Sixth and\r\nSeventh Reports of the International Committee\r\nor the Taxonomy of Viruses are partly followed,\r\nespecially by use of a virus species name or\r\nvernacular name for the not fully described\r\nviruses. Following are virus species (including\r\nviroids and phytoplasmas) and virus diseases in\r\nalphabetical order by common names.\r\nAbelia Latent Tymovirus\r\nSymptomless on Abelia; occurs in Eastern USA.\r\nAbutilon Infectious Variegation;\r\nAbutilon Mosaic Bigeminivirus\r\nA single variegated seedling found among green\r\nplants imported into England from the West\r\nIndies in 1868 was propagated vegetatively as\r\nan ornamental variety. The bright yellow mottling on green leaves tends to disappear in subdued light. Transmission is by grafting,\r\noccasionally by seed, and, in native Brazil, by\r\nwhitefly Bemisia tabaci. Plants may recover if\r\nvariegated leaves are persistently removed but\r\nmay be reinfected.\r\nAlbutilon Yellows Closterovirus\r\nTransmitted by Triaulerodes abutilonea. Infected\r\nplants are chlorotic.\r\nAlligatorweed Stunting Closterovirus\r\nOccurs in North America region and Florida.\r\nAlfalfa Mosaic Alfamovirus\r\nPotato, Celery Calico; Bean Yellow Dot. Various\r\nstrains of the alfalfa virus are transmitted by\r\ncotton, pea, and other aphids to bean, clovers,\r\npea, cucumber, potato, tomato, zinnia, tumbleweed, poison hemlock, wild carrot, Japanese\r\npachysandra, and other hosts. Calico is a minor\r\npotato disease in California and Idaho. Leaf\r\nspots are irregular, brilliant yellow to gray; yield\r\nmay be reduced. Celery has a conspicuous\r\nyellow-green mosaic; bean has small, necrotic\r\nlesions.\r\nR.K.

        "html": "Wilt Diseases\r\nTo wilt means to lose freshness or to become\r\nflaccid. Wilting in plants may be temporary, due\r\nto too rapid transpiration; or it may be permanent, due to continued loss of water beyond the\r\nrecovery point. Disease organisms, by reducing\r\nor inhibiting water conduction, may cause permanent wilting. Because wilt diseases are systemic, and tied up with the entire vascular\r\nsystem of a plant, they are usually more important, and harder to control, than localized spots\r\nor cankers. In many cases the fungus enters the\r\nplant from the soil through wounds or root\r\nhairs and cannot be controlled by protective\r\nspraying. Often, although the fungus is present\r\nonly near the base of a plant, the first symptom is\r\na flagging or wilting or yellowing of a branch\r\nnear the top. Many species of Fusarium are\r\nresponsible for important wilts and \u201cyellows.\u201d\r\nVerticillium is a common cause of wilt in\r\nmaples, other trees, and shrubs, but most important among the wilt pathogens are two species of\r\nCeratocystis, one causing oak wilt, the other\r\nDutch elm disease.\r\nAcremonium (Cephalosporium)\r\n\u25b6 Leaf Spots.\r\nAcremonium diospyri (formerly\r\nCephalosporium diospyri).

All native oak species\r\nare susceptible, also chinquapin, chestnut,\r\nlithocarpus (and apples in experimental inoculation); but red oaks succumb most rapidly. Scouting for the disease has been done largely by\r\nairplane, the discolored foliage being visible up\r\nto a half mile.\r\nFirst symptoms are a slight crinkling and paling of leaves, followed by progressive wilting,\r\nbronzing, and browning of leaf blades from margins toward midribs and defoliation progressively downward and inward throughout the\r\ntree. Red oaks almost never recover and may be\r\nkilled within 4 to 8 weeks after symptoms appear.\r\nWhite and burr oaks may persist for some years,\r\nwith affected branches dying in a staghead effect.\r\nThe first internal symptoms are the formation\r\nof gums and tyloses in the xylem. After wilting,\r\nmycelial mats are formed between the bark and\r\nwood, and the bark cracks from the pressure\r\nexerted. Perithecia are formed in these mats,\r\nwhich have a sour odor and attract insects. Nitulid\r\nbeetles, fruit flies, brentids, springtails, bark beetles, and possibly other insects get conidia and\r\nascospores on or in their bodies as they feed, and\r\ncan inoculate other trees through wounds. We\r\nknow that ascospores remain viable several\r\nmonths on insects and can be distributed through\r\nfecal pellets, but we do not yet know how great\r\na role they play in the spread of oak wilt. Birds\r\nhave been suspected as carriers but are not yet\r\nindicted. Local spread is largely by root grafts,\r\none tree infecting others within 50 feet and with\r\ngrafts possible between red and white oaks, not\r\nlimited to the same species.\r\nControl In residential areas infected trees should\r\nbe removed. In forests, felling may wound other\r\ntrees and spread the disease more than letting the\r\ndead tree remain but treated so that it is not\r\ninfective. Different states handle the problem in\r\ndifferent ways. In Pennsylvania, each infected\r\ntree is cut, with all other oaks within 50 feet,\r\nand ammate crystals are placed on each stump.\r\nIn North Carolina stumps and felled trees are\r\nthoroughly sprayed. In West Virginia the trees\r\nare left standing, but a deep girdle into the heartwood dries out the tree so that mycelial mats and\r\nspores do not form.\r\nCeratocystis (Ceratostomella) ulmi (Graphium\r\nulmi) (see \u25b6Ophiostoma ulmi and \u25b6O. novoulmi).

Dutch Elm Disease, on American,\r\nSibirian, Slippery and European elms in 31 states,\r\nMaine to North Carolina and west to Oklahoma,\r\nand on cedar. This fatal disease is not really of\r\nDutch origin but is so named because it was first\r\ninvestigated in Holland. It was noticed in Europe\r\nabout 1918, first in France, then in Belgium and\r\nHolland. It spread throughout central and southern Europe, then into England and Wales. In\r\nmany places it virtually exterminated the elms,\r\nincluding those on the famous avenues at Versailles. It is suspected that the fungus came to\r\nEurope from Asia during World War I.\r\nDutch elm disease was discovered in Ohio in\r\n1930 and in New Jersey in 1933. It has spread\r\nnorth through New England and has become very\r\nserious in the Midwest. In 1948, the disease was\r\nfound in Denver, Colorado, and in 1976 in California. It is now fairly widespread in reports of its\r\noccurrence in the United States. The spread of the\r\nfungus is linked with the presence of the large and\r\nsmall European bark beetles, Scolytus scolytus\r\nand S. multistriatus. Only the latter is established\r\nin this country, having arrived in Boston about\r\n1919. Patient detective work established the fact\r\nthat the fungus came here in elm burl logs\r\nimported for furniture veneer. After one such\r\ninfected elm burl was found in Baltimore in\r\n1934, months of scouting went on in the vicinity\r\nof ports of entry, railroad distributing yards, and\r\nveneer plants. Such backtracking showed the\r\ninfected material had come in at four ports of\r\nentry and had been carried by 16 railroads over\r\n13,000 miles in 21 states. From this source the\r\ndisease got its start in at least 13 areas in 7 states.\r\nElm nursery stock is, of course, quarantined,\r\nand elm burls are embargoed; but who would\r\n434 Wilt Diseases"

Dishes have to be\r\ncrated, however, and several times since 1933\r\nEnglish dishes crated with elm wood carrying\r\nbark beetles and Ceratocystis have been\r\nintercepted. All American and European elms\r\nare susceptible. Asiatic elms, Ulmus parvifolia\r\nand U. pumila, are resistant. A seedling elm,\r\nnamed Christine Buisman for its Netherlands\u2019\r\ndiscoverer, is highly resistant, though not\r\nimmune, and is now available. Other promising\r\nseedlings have been tested by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\r\nSymptoms are apparent from the latter part of\r\nMay until late fall. The acute form of the disease\r\nis characterized by sudden and severe wilting.\r\nFirst the young leaves, then all leaves wilt and\r\nwither, sometimes so rapidly that they dry, curl,\r\nand fall while still green, before they can turn the\r\nusual brown of dead leaves. Sometimes terminal\r\ntwigs are curled into a shepherd\u2019s crook. Chronic\r\ndisease symptoms are gradual, often taking all\r\nsummer for complete defoliation. In many cases\r\nindividual branches or \u201cflags\u201d appear, the\r\nyellowed leaves conspicuous against the rest of\r\nthe tree; but sometimes all leaves gradually turn\r\nyellow. In another type of chronic disease, trees\r\nleaf out late in spring, with sparse chlorotic\r\nfoliage and a staghead appearance. When\r\nan affected twig is cut across, the vessels or\r\nwater-conducting tubes show dark brown or\r\nblack, being clogged with bladderlike tyloses\r\nand brown gummy substances (see Fig. 1). The\r\nproduction of these substances is thought to be\r\nstimulated by a toxin secreted by the fungus and\r\ncarried in the sapstream. Symptoms are not\r\ndependent on the physical presence of fungal\r\nhyphae in all parts of the tree. The fungus lives\r\nin the sapwood, fruiting in cracks between wood\r\nand loosened bark and in bark beetle galleries\r\nunder the bark. This fruiting is of the anamorph\r\nstate, spores being produced in structures called\r\ncoremia. These are black stalks about 1 mm high\r\nwith enlarged heads bearing vast numbers of\r\nminute, pear-shaped spores embedded in\r\na translucent drop of sticky liquid. Spores in the\r\nvessels increase in a yeastlike manner. The perithecial stage, not found in nature, has been produced in culture by crossing plus and minus\r\nstrains of the fungus.\r\nAlthough the smaller European elm bark beetle is chiefly responsible for spread of the pathogen, at times the native elm bark beetle,\r\nHylurgopinus rufipes, is the agent. When the\r\nadult beetles emerge from under the bark of\r\ndead or dying trees, they bring along sticky\r\nspores on their bodies and deposit them as they\r\nfeed in the crotches of young twigs or leaf axils of\r\nnearby healthy trees. Although the beetles feed\r\non healthy wood, usually within 200 feet of their\r\nFig. 1 Dutch elm disease.

There is a second\r\nbrood in August and September, but the\r\noverwintering one, emerging in May, is most to\r\nbe feared. Because the disease often follows traffic routes, automobiles probably account for\r\na good deal of long-distance spread. So far as\r\nwe know, the only other natural means of infection is by root grafts, made when trees are planted\r\nso close together that their roots touch. This is\r\nanother argument for diversified planting,\r\nrather than streets closely lined with but one\r\ntype of tree.\r\nControl In the first few frantic years an enormous amount of money (more than $26 million)\r\nwas spent on trying to eradicate the disease by\r\nremoving and burning diseased trees; and while\r\nthis was undoubtedly helpful, it did not stop the\r\nspread of wilt. The Federal government has now\r\nleft the control of Dutch elm disease up to the\r\ncommunities and is restricting its efforts to\r\nresearch. Many towns have taken a laissez-faire\r\nattitude, thinking that our elms are doomed anyway, so why waste money? Other, more enlightened communities have proved that a sustained\r\ncontrol program keeps the disease down to\r\na negligible 1 or 2 %, or less, and that the cost is\r\nfar, far less than that of continuous removal of\r\ndead trees.\r\nThe Midwestern Chapter of the National\r\nShade Tree Conference, in its Guide for Community-Wide Control of Dutch Elm Disease,\r\nsuggests:\r\n1.

Destruction of known sources of elm wood\r\nactually or potentially hazardous for spread\r\nof disease. Elm wood piles should be\r\ndestroyed completely, or each log stripped of\r\nbark and the bark destroyed. Diseased trees\r\nshould be burned, on site if possible, or thoroughly sprayed. Wood chips from diseased\r\nelms may still carry the fungus; material\r\nshould be burned, not used for mulches.\r\n4. Spraying of healthy trees to prevent infection.\r\n5. Maintenance of elms in healthy condition to\r\nprevent invasions of bark beetles. This\r\nincludes proper watering and fertilizing,\r\nspraying to control summer foliage pests if\r\nnecessary.\r\nA single annual DORMANT SPRAY is now\r\nconsidered sufficient to protect healthy elms from\r\nbark beetles if enough material is used and complete coverage is obtained. This spray was originally a very heavy dosage of DDT, which caused\r\nsome bird mortality and other environmental problems.

        "html": "Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici -\r\nFusarium Wilt of tomato, general, in many sections the most damaging tomato disease in field\r\nand greenhouse. Chief losses are in states where\r\nair temperatures are rather high during most of\r\nthe season, susceptible varieties dying or producing little fruit. Losses go up to 30,000 t of canning\r\ntomatoes, or 10 to 35 % of the crop in many\r\nstates.\r\nIn seedlings there is downward curvature of\r\nthe oldest leaves followed by wilting and death.\r\nIn older plants the disease is most evident as fruit\r\nbegins to mature, lower leaves turning yellow,\r\nfirst on one side of the stem or leaflets on one\r\nside of the petiole. One shoot may be killed\r\nbefore the rest of the plant shows symptoms.\r\nThe fungus enters through roots and grows\r\ninto the stem, where it produces the toxic substances causing wilting and eventual death. The\r\nvascular system in the stem shows a dark brown\r\ndiscoloration. In severe infections the fungus\r\ngrows into fruit and seeds, but such fruits usually\r\ndrop, and seed is not used. Almost all original\r\ninfection comes from the soil, the Fusarium\r\noperating best in light sandy soils and at\r\ntemperatures between 80\u0001 and 90 \u0001F, but the\r\ndisease is spread widely in transplants. It is\r\nencouraged by low potassium and high nitrogen\r\nnutrients.\r\nControl Start seedlings in clean soil; do not grow\r\nin the same land more than once in 4 years. The\r\nuse of resistant varieties is the chief means of\r\ncontrol. Marglobe, Pritchard and Rutgers are\r\nmoderately resistant, but infestation by nematodes may predispose even these to wilt. Pan\r\nAmerica, Southland, Homestead and Jefferson\r\nare more highly resistant. Treating soil with nematicides may reduce incidence of wilt even\r\nthough the wilt pathogen is not killed.\r\nFusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis Muskmelon\r\nFusarium Wilt, similar to that of watermelon,\r\nimportant in Minnesota, New York, New Jersey\r\nand Maryland. Seeds rot in soil; seedlings dampoff; vines wilt. Fungus persists in soil and is\r\ncarried internally in seed. Varieties Golden\r\nGopher and Iroquois are quite resistant.\r\nFusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum Watermelon Wilt, general on watermelon, also on\r\ncitron. The fungus is transported in and on seed\r\nand persists in soil 15 to 18 years. It rots seeds or\r\nseedlings, causes wilting of plant, sometimes\r\nwith cottony mycelium on surface of dying\r\nvines. Resistant varieties include Improved\r\nKleckley Sweet and Klondike.\r\nFusarium oxysporum f. sp. perniciosum Mimosa Wilt on mimosa from New Jersey\r\nand Maryland to Florida. This extremely pernicious wilt started about 1930 at Tryon, North\r\nCarolina, and mimosas have wilted and died at\r\na rapid rate ever since. The wilt appeared in one\r\ncity block at Morgantown, North Carolina in\r\n1943, and by 1947 trees were dead and dying on\r\n232 blocks.\r\nThe first external symptom is a wilting and\r\nyellowing of leaves on some of the branches,\r\ncausing foliage to hang down, then die and\r\ndrop. Death of the tree follows from a month to\r\na year after first infection. The trunk has a brown\r\nring of discolored sapwood, usually in the current\r\nannual ring, and the color may extend out into the\r\nbranches. The xylem is plugged with brown\r\ngummy substances. Small branches may have\r\na one-sided wilting with the bark flattened over\r\ncollapsing tissue. The disease has been spreading\r\nin Maryland since 1947, in Florida since 1952.\r\nAs with other Fusaria, this is a soil fungus\r\nentering through the roots, and eradication of\r\ndiseased trees has no effect on spread of the\r\nwilt. Nematodes, by their wounds, may increase\r\nthe incidence of wilt. Out of a great many seedlings grown from seed collected from Maryland\r\nto Louisiana, inoculated several times with the\r\nfungus and planted in infested soil, some have\r\nremained mostly disease-free. These have been\r\npropagated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Released for commercial sale are Charlotte\r\nand Tryon.\r\nFusarium oxysporum f. sp. pisi Pea Wilt,\r\ncaused by race 1 of this pathogen and Near Wilt,\r\ncaused by race 2. Race 1, confined to pea, produces stunted plants, pale yellow green, with\r\nleaves curled downward, stem thickened and brittle near the ground. Plants wilt and die prematurely. The disease may cause more or less\r\ncircular bare spots in the field, enlarging each\r\nyear if peas are planted continuously, encouraged\r\nFusarium 439"

Maples may wilt\r\nsuddenly in midsummer, often a large branch or\r\none side of the tree drying and dying while the\r\nother side stays fresh. The sapwood of the\r\ninfected side has greenish streaks, and sometimes\r\nslime flux develops on the bark. The disease can\r\nbe chronic, progressing slowly for several seasons, or acute, affecting the entire tree in a few\r\nweeks. In elms the leaves may be smaller than\r\nnormal, with a drooping flaccidity in hot hours of\r\nthe day. Later there is a slight yellowing, deepening until the foliage is a striking lemon yellow.\r\nDefoliation starts at time of first yellowing, and\r\nquite often branchlets drop as well as leaves.\r\nSapwood discoloration is brown, and the disease\r\ncannot be told positively from Dutch elm disease\r\nwithout laboratory cultures. Tyloses and gums\r\nare formed in the wood as with other toxinproducing fungi. The fungus always progresses\r\nupward through the xylem vessels so there is little\r\ndanger of downward infection of the main trunk\r\nfrom pruning operations. Progress is slowed by\r\nadequate moisture and by high nitrogen fertilizers, ammonium sulfate being particularly\r\nhelpful.\r\nVerticillium wilt is also a problem on rose\r\nunderstock. Ragged Robin, Odorata, and\r\nMultiflora are very susceptible, Dr. Huey less\r\nsusceptible, and Manetti resistant.\r\nIn fruit trees the wilt is often known as black\r\nheart or verticillosis. It is common in apricots,\r\nless so in almonds and peaches; branches may\r\ndrop their leaves and die. Also susceptible are\r\nsweet and sour cherry, avocado, plum and prune.\r\nOn bush fruits \u2013 raspberry, blackberry, dewberry and youngberry \u2013 the disease is commonly\r\nknown as blue stem. The symptoms appear late in\r\nthe season, leaves turning pale, cane tips bending\r\ndownward, canes taking on a bluish color, lower\r\nleaves wilting and drying. Death is often delayed\r\nuntil the season after first infection. Black raspberries are more susceptible than red. The disease\r\nis sometime serious on strawberries, especially in\r\nCalifornia, but cannot always be separated from\r\nroot rots. Plants may collapse in large areas at the\r\nbeginning of hot weather.\r\nVerticillium wilt is very destructive to mint in\r\nMichigan and Indiana, also reported, though not so\r\nserious in Oregon and Washington. Infected plants\r\nare stunted, defoliated, and killed; yield of oil is\r\ngreatly reduced. The fungus attacks all species of\r\nmint, but peppermint is most susceptible. There\r\nare some resistant hybrids. Deep plowing,\r\ninverting the soil, has reduced the amount of wilt.\r\nVerticillium is especially damaging to tomatoes in Utah and California. First symptoms are\r\nyellowing of older leaves and wilting of tips\r\nduring the day; later, margins of all leaves curl\r\nupward, then leaves drop (see Fig. 3). Plants are\r\nstunted; fruit is small. Moderately resistant varieties Riverside and Essar have been developed\r\nfor California. Symptoms on potatoes are rather\r\nindefinite, but often there is yellowing of lower\r\nleaves, shortening of internodes, and rosetting of\r\nthe top (see Fig. 3). Resistant varieties may be\r\nsymptomless hosts. Verticillium wilt is common\r\non eggplant and okra, rather rare on pepper. It\r\noccurs on Chinese yard-long bean, rhubarb and\r\nNew Zealand spinach.\r\nOn herbaceous perennials in eastern gardens\r\nI find Verticillium wilt common on aconite and\r\nchrysanthemum, with leaves turning dark brown\r\nand hanging down along the stem. When the stem\r\nis cut across near the base, a circle of black dots\r\nindicates the fungus in the vessels. Such plants\r\nseldom die immediately but flower poorly and\r\ngradually peter out. Wilt was serious on greenhouse chrysanthemums until a wholesale commercial concern started to provide healthy\r\npropagating stock from cultured cuttings. Other\r\nornamental hosts include abutilon, aralia, barberry, begonia, China aster, carnation, dahlia,\r\nfremontia, geranium, marguerite, peony, poppy,\r\nsnapdragon (see Fig. 4), stock and viburnum.\r\nVerticillium 441"

I have added to\r\nthese recent records as I have run across them in the literature and a few\r\npersonal observations. Inevitably I have missed some, and there will be many\r\nmore appearing while this text is in press; so the lists cannot be regarded as\r\ncomplete. There are a great many more records than in the previous editions,\r\nbut with surveys bringing new reports every day, any such list is out of date by\r\nthe time it is typed; and by the time it is printed and available, many months\r\nlater, it is sure to be far from complete. This check list is offered as a helpful\r\nguide, a foundation on which to build. It is by no means the last word.\r\nThe hosts selected for inclusion in the Handbook are those trees, shrubs,\r\nvines, flowers, and vegetables likely to be grown in home gardens. Native\r\nplants sometimes grown in wild gardens are here, and some forest trees if they\r\nare sometimes used as ornamentals. Some plants more often grown for profit\r\nare included if they have anyplace around the home. Hosts are listed alphabetically by common names except where the scientific names mean less\r\nconfusion. Often there are several common names, and the Latin name is\r\nmore likely to be generally recognized.\r\nThe geographical distribution of diseases can be taken only as a general\r\nguide. It is likely that a disease present in New York is also present in\r\nneighboring states but has not been officially reported, or that I have missed\r\nseeing the report, or that a long list of states would take too much\r\nroom. Diseases listed as \u201cgeneral\u201d are prevalent throughout the host range;\r\n\u201cwidespread\u201d means found over a wide area but not prevalent; \u201coccasional\u201d\r\nmeans of infrequent occurrence.\r\nFungi possibly parasitic that have been recorded as present on leaves or\r\nwoody plant parts but not as causing a specific disease have been omitted. Brief\r\ncomments, following some of the listings, sort out a few of the more important\r\nproblems, but specific descriptions and control measures are to be found in\r\n\u25b6Part III.

In the disease section (\u25b6Part III) the pathogens\r\nare likewise listed in boldface, but in alphabetical order under each heading such\r\nas rot or blight, and then the common name of the disease is given in cap and\r\nsmall caps.\r\nFor instance, your acacia seems to be dying, and you think it may have\r\na root rot; perhaps you can see objects like toadstools at the base. You look up\r\nACACIA and check the possibilities until you come to the line: ROT,\r\nMushroom Root. Armillaria mellea, occasional; Clitocybe tabescens, FL.\r\n\u201cOccasional\u201d means that this rot might be found wherever acacias grow.\r\nYou live in California so you turn to the section head \u25b6 ROTS in \u25b6 Part III\r\nand thumb down through the A\u2019s until you come to ARMILLARIA. Under\r\nthe name is the classification of the genus, but you can leave that to the\r\npathologist and go to: \u201cArmillaria mellea; MUSHROOM ROOT ROT of\r\ntrees and shrubs, also known as Armillaria root rot or toadstool disease.\u201d You\r\nlearn that this disease is especially common in California, and that the honeycolored mushrooms or toadstools are not always present for diagnosis but that\r\nblack shoestrings are also telltale characters. You conclude that this is your\r\nfungus, and you read on to see what can be done to the soil to prevent\r\na recurrence of the problem. But before you do anything too drastic, you should\r\ndiscuss the whole situation with someone at the University of California, for\r\nyou could be mistaken.\r\nIt cannot be expected that a gardener can make accurate diagnosis of\r\ndisease from reading this Handbook any more than reading a medical book\r\ncan turn a layperson into a doctor. It takes years of experience to recognize\r\ndiseases on sight, from macroscopic symptoms, and it takes some technical\r\ntraining to recognize diseases by studying the fungus under the microscope\r\nand perhaps growing it in culture. For airtight identification of a bacterium or\r\nfungus with a new disease the organism must be repeatedly isolated in\r\nculture; the disease must be produced in healthy plants by inoculating them\r\nwith a pure culture of the organism; and then the fungus, or bacterium, must\r\nbe reisolated from the artificially infected plant.\r\nIn some cases the small number of known diseases for a plant together with\r\ntheir distinctive type and geographical distribution makes layperson identification relatively reliable. In other cases, specific identification, other than to know\r\nthat it is a leaf spot, is unnecessary. And in still other cases, specimens should be\r\nsent to your state experiment station for diagnosis. It is my hope that the\r\noverburdened extension pathologist, receiving some unusual specimen, will\r\nfind this list of host plants and their diseases of value in speeding up\r\nidentifications.\r\n446 IV Host Plants and Their Diseases"

The commercial grower may, in a wet\r\nseason, apply nearly 20 sprays to keep scab\r\nunder control. The homeowner thinks one or\r\ntwo are enough.

Scab is the most important apple disease,\r\nand proper timing of early season sprays is\r\nmost essential. Bitter rot, black rot, sometimes\r\nrust need attention.

Verticillium albo-atrum, NY, WA.\r\nOne of the chief delphinium problems is\r\na condition known as \u201cblacks\u201d, which looks like\r\na disease and is often confused with bacterial black\r\nspot but is caused by cyclamen mites. Plants are\r\nstunted and deformed; budsturn black. The bacterial\r\ndisease causes blacktar spots onleaves but no deformity, no stunting of the whole plant. Crown rot or\r\nsouthern blight is often fatal to delphiniums. When\r\nyellowing and wilting appear, check the soil around\r\nthe crown for reddish sclerotia and white mycelium\r\nand take immediate sanitary measures. Many foot,\r\ncollar, and root rots and stem cankers afflict delphinium. Because of these, many gardeners grow hybrid\r\ndelphinium as biennials, rotating locations, choosing well-drained sites. Virus diseases are more\r\nimportant along the Pacific Coast. Use virus-free\r\nplanting stock and rogue out infected individuals.\r\nDemorphotheca\r\nVIRUS.

Powdery mildew, a problem on the Pacific\r\nCoast, is increasing in eastern gardens. Brown canker and other cane diseases are best controlled at\r\nspring pruning, by cutting out infected canes and\r\ncutting other canes just above a bud, not leaving\r\nany stub to die back. Cankers are increased by\r\nexcessive winter protection. Where temperatures\r\npermit, as in the Central Atlantic region, eliminate\r\nsoil mounding and other special winter treatment.\r\nRoses are sensitive to many chemicals; it is\r\nimportant to distinguish spray injury from\r\nblackspot and not increase the dosage because\r\nyou think you are not getting control. Combination\r\nsprays or dusts should take care of most diseases,\r\nas well as insects, in one operation. The bacterial\r\ncrown gall is occasionally present on plants purchased from a nursery.
