        "html": "1. Gummosis/Bark Splitting\nSymptoms\n- Symptoms include rotted roots; cracked bark, accompanied by gumming.\n- Water-soaked, reddish-brown to black bark at the soil line.\n- Discolored tissue in the lower trunk. Yellowing, sparse foliage and death of the tree.\n- Excess soil moisture favors production and spread of zoospores.\n- Therefore, increased drainage and careful irrigation is an important factor in disease management.\nManagement\n- Resistant Rootstock\n- Cultural Control\nPlant trees on high enough so that the first lateral roots are just covered with soil.\n- Budding of the plants at height of 9 inches\n- Chemical control\nCopper 3 gm/lit. of water\nFosetyl-AL 2.5 gm/ lit. of water\nMetalaxyl+Mancozeb 2.5gm/lit. of water\n2. Citrus Scab\nSymptoms\n- Citrus scab attacks the fruit, leaves and twigs, producing slightly raised, irregular scab-by or wart-like outgrowths.\n- The scabs are grey or pinkish at first and become darker with age.\n- They are more common on lemon fruits than leaves.\n- The raised lumps associated with scab can be confused with symptoms caused by the disease botrytis or with wind rub abrasions.\n3. Citrus Melanose\nSymptoms\nLeaves\n- Lesions begin as small, circular dark depressions with yellow margins.\n- As the disease progresses, spots become raised and turn dark brown.\n- Leaves turn yellow and prematurely drop.\nFruit\n- Spots initially are small, light brown, and sunken.\n- As the disease progresses, spots become dark and raised.\n- Spots that are close together can coalesce to form a rough-irregular or rough surface.\n- Damage is typically superficial on fruit.\n- Lesions can typically be found on dying twigs.\nIt can be severe following rainy periods in the spring and seems to be worse when preceded by a freeze.\nControl/Management of Scab/Melanose Diseases\n- Cultural practices, Sanitation \u2013 pruning \u2013 No intercropping & careful irrigation .\n- 3 Sprays are Recommended to control the diseases.\n- 1st SPRAY (Before Flowering) Copper Based Fungicides e.g. Copper Oxycholoride or Copper Hydrooxide @ 3gm/lit. of water\n- 2nd SPRAY (After Petal Fall) Difenoconazl+Azoxystrobin ( Amistar or Nanok @ 1ml/lit. of water)\n- 3rd SPRAY (Moon Soon) Copper Based Fungicides Copper Oxycholoride or Copper Hydrooxide @ 3gm/lit. of water\n4. Citrus Canker\nSymptoms\n- Young lesions are raised on both leaf surfaces, particularly on the lower leaf surface.\n- The pustules later become corky and crater-like, with raised margins, sunken centers and surrounded by a yellow halo.\n- Fruit lesions vary in size because the rind is susceptible for a longer period of time and more than one infection cycle can occur on fruit.\n- Twigs and stem infections resemble those on fruit.\n- The lesions are raised with a corky appearance and can support long term survival of the bacterium.\n- Major citrus canker outbreaks generally occur when new shoots are emerging or when fruit are in the early stages of development.\n- Citrus canker is mostly a cosmetic disease, but when conditions are highly favorable for infection, it causes defoliation, shoot die-back, and fruit drop.\nDisease Management\nExclusion\nThe first line of defense against citrus canker is exclusion.\nSanitation\nNumerous cases of new infections of citrus canker are linked to human and mechanical transmission.\nEradication\nOnce introduced into an area, elimination of inoculum by removal and destruction of infected and exposed trees is the most accepted form of eradication.\nChemical Control\n- 1st spray of Bordeauxe mixture (1%) after fruit harvest)\n- 2nd spray during the month of April Copper Oxycholoride @3gm/lit. of water)\n- 3rd spray during the month of July-August Copper Hydrooxide @2.5gm/lit. of water\n5. Citrus Greening\nSymptoms\n- Stylar end greening\n- Stylar end greening on samples of various fruit infected with HLB. The infected fruit is contrasted against non-infected normal fruit. (Note the greening at the stylarend in contrast to the normal orange color).\n- Leaf mottle typical for greening disease\n- leaf mottle and general chlorosis of leaves.\n- Seed abortion\n- Classical seed abortion from fruit of an HLB infected sweet orange tree. Note the small purple colored seeds contrasted with normal seeds. This is also typical for stubborn disease.\nManagement\n- Removal of infected trees\n- Vector control ( citrus psylla) by spraying Novastar or Confidar @1ml/lit. of water\n- Disease free planting material\n6. Citrus Psylla\nIntegrated Control Measures\n- Following practices should be used to reduce the damage by citrus psylla:\n- Monitor the population of citrus psylla by hanging yellow sticky cards on trees to capture adults.\n- Prune the trees after the last harvest fruits.\n- In biological control lady bird beetle and Temarixia radiata should be used as bio-control agents.\n- Chemical control by chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, imidacloprid, and bifenthrin can reduce the population upto 70-80%.\n7. Citrus Mealybug\nIntegrated Control of Citrus Mealybug\n- Remove alternate host plants.\n- Mealybugs are primarily managed by destroying their eggs by cultural practices\n- Native predators include lady beetles, lacewings, and syrphid flies.\n- Application of Carbofuran early in December with irrigation water kills the emerging nymphs/crawlers.\n- Spray of bifenthrin, imidacloprid, acetamiprid @ 1.25 ml/liter of water or methidathion @ 2 ml/ liter of water on the soil or on the trunk of the tree should be applied later.\n8. Citrus Whitefly\nIntegrated Management of Citrus Whitefly\n- Several parasites and predators attack the citrus whitefly. Lacewing larva (Chrysoperla sp.) feeds on whitefly nymphs and a wasp Encarsia is useful parasitoid of citrus whitefly.\n- Yellow sticky traps are helpful for monitoring and suppressing adult populations.\n- Always inspect new plants for whiteflies and nymphs before introducing them in the greenhouse or garden\n- Water sprays (syringing) may also be useful in dislodging adults. Watering can also reduce the hot, dry dusty conditions that favor whiteflies and inhibit their natural enemies.\n- If populations are high, use a least-toxic, short-lived organic pesticide such as acetamiprid to establish control.\n9. Citrus Thrips\nIntegrated Management of Thrips\n- Monitoring citrus for citrus thrips begins at the initiation of bloom, but becomes critical at petal fall (90% blossom drop) in late-March to early April.\n- A number of natural enemies attack citrus thrips including predaceous mites, spiders, lacewings, minute pirate bugs, etc.\n- Spinetoram, spinosad, or abamectin are recommended to avoid severe mortality of natural enemies.\n10. Citrus Red Scale\nIntegrated Management of Scales\n- Trees should be internally pruned and opened up so that the parasites can gain access to the scales.\n- Insecticides such as pyriproxyfen, buprofezin, and Spirotetramat are quite safer to use.\n11. Citrus Leafminer\nIntegrated Management of Leafminer\n- Application of fertilizers in winter to promote flush growth in spring when the pest is either absent or relatively scarce.\n- Pruning of late summer and autumn flush growth can also be used to limit and remove unsightly infestations on home garden trees.\n- Three of the most effective wasps are Ageniaspis citricola and Cirrospilus quadristriatus and Semiolacher petiolatus.\n- Imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and spinosad are recommended for Leafminer control.\n12. Fruit Fly Insect Control\nIntegrated Management of Fruit Flies\n- Following integrated control measures should be adopted for the fruit flies:\n- Eradication of alternate and non-essential host plants.\n- The collection and destruction of fallen, damaged and overripe fruits is strongly recommended to reduce the resident population of fruit flies.\n- Fruit should be picked off from the trees as it ripens; this stops the flies from laying eggs inside it, and prevents any larvae surviving.\n- Monitoring of fruit fly population in the citrus orchards by installing sex pheromone traps of yellow and/or transparent colors is highly recommended in the early summer to late in the season. Five traps per acre should be installed. Methyl eugenol traps are used for male fruit flies while for female traps baited with protein hydrolysate should be used. These traps are impregnated with insecticide spinosad."

        "html": "Citrus: Diseases and Symptoms\nCitrus scab\nDisease symptoms:\n- Initially small, semi-translucent dots like lesion develops on leaves which become sharply defined pustular elevations. The opposite surface corresponding to the warty growth shows a circular depression with a pink to red centre.\n- On the fruit, lesions consist of corky projections which often break into scab affecting larger areas on the fruits\nSurvival and spread:\n- Fungal survive in the infected leaves through overwintering lesions on the fruit or leaves and/or from any scab infections that have developed on the new spring flush.\nFavourable conditions:\n- Scab can be particularly severe on summer growth flushes. Summer wet periods associated with rain showers and dew is highly conducive for spore germination and infection.\nCitrus canker\nDisease symptoms:\n- Initially, disease appears as minute water soaked round, yellow spots which enlarge slightly and turn brown, eruptive and corky.\n- These pustules are surrounded by a characteristic yellow halo.\n- Canker lesions on the fruit do not possess the yellow halo as on leaves. Several lesions on fruit may coalesce to form larger canker.\n- Due to severe infections the there may be defoliation, and twig and stem may show die-back symptoms.\nSurvival and spread:\n- In lesions on Citrus, and can also survive for long periods in diseased plant tissues\n- Citrus leaf miners (Phyllocnistis citrella) help in the dissemination of the pathogen.\nFavourable conditions:\n- Spring seasion is favourable for the development of disease\nCitrus tristeza disease\nDisease symptoms:\n- Disease affected tree leaves becomes chlorotic in the early stages. Gradually the leaves drop and the defoliated twigs show die-back.\n- Diseased trees usually blossom heavily.\n- Under the tree bark stem pitting can be observed.\n- Trees with stem pitting are stunted and set less fruits.\n- The fruits are of smaller size and of poor quality (insipid fruits).\nTransmission and favourable conditions:\n- The disease is transmitted in semi persistent manner by aphid Aphis gossypii.\n- Aphids are more active in warm summer conditions and increase their population as well as spread of the disease.\nGummosis\nDisease symptoms:\n- Disease starts as water soaked large patches on the basal portions of the stem near the ground level.\n- Bark in such parts dries, shrinks and cracks and shreds in lengthwise vertical strips.\n- Later profuse exudation of gum from the bark of the trunk occurs.\n- Considerable amount of gum formation in sweet oranges may be observed, but relatively little in grapefruit.\nSurvival and spread:\n- The fungus survives in the form of dormant mycelium and under moist conditions. The fungi produces large numbers of motile zoospores, which are splashed onto the tree trunks.\n- Secondary infections often occur through lesions created by Phytophthora\nFavourable conditions:\n- The Phytophthora species causing gummosis develop rapidly under moist and cool conditions.\nGreening or Huanglongbing\nDisease symptoms:\n- Affected leaves show small circular green islands within the chlorotic areas.\n- Heavy leaf fall occurs with the onset of summer.\n- Twig die-back may also occurs.\n- Affected areas of the fruits remain green and gives bitter taste\n- Affected fruits show reduction in size, loopsided growth and oblique columella.\n- Seeds are poorly developed, dark coloured and aborted.\nTransmission and favourable conditions:\n- The bacterium is transmitted by the psyllids Triozaerytreae Del Guercio. The bacteria can be acquired by the insects in the nymphal stages and the bacteria may be transmitted throughout the life span of the psyllid.\nAnthracnose\nDisease symptoms:\n- Leaf - common symptoms are a more or less circular, flat area, light tan in color with a prominent purple margin that at a later phase of infection will show the fruiting bodies of the fungus (tiny dispersed black flecks).\n- Tissues injured by various environmental factors (such as mesophyll collapse or heavy infestations of spider mites) are more susceptible to anthracnose colonization.\n- Fruit - anthracnose usually only occurs on fruit that have been injured by other agents, such as sunburn, chemical burn, pest damage, bruising, or extended storage periods. The lesions are brown to black spots of 1.5 mm or greater diameter. The decay is usually firm and dry but if deep enough can soften the fruit. If kept under humid conditions, the spore masses are pink to salmon, but if kept dry, the spores appear brown to black. On ethylene degreened fruit, lesions are flat and silver in color with a leathery texture. On degreened fruit, much of the rind is affected. The lesions will eventually become brown to grey black leading to soft rot.\nSurvival and spread\n- Once the spores germinate, they form a resting structure that allows them to remain dormant until an injury occurs\nFavourable conditions:\n- Cool weather (temp 20\u00b0C) responsible for development of disease in plants\n- Long period of high relative humidity >80% with mists\nSooty mould\nDisease symptoms:\n- The dark, felty growth from sooty mold can be scraped off of plant surfaces, unlike fruit rots that extend into the rind and flesh.\n- Where sooty mold occurs, look for aphids, citricola scale, cottony cushion scale, mealy bugs, whiteflies, and other phloem-sucking insects that excrete honeydew on which sooty mold fungi grow.\nPowdery mildew\nDisease symptoms: Leaf\n- White \u2018powdery\u2019 spores develop mostly on the upper leaf surface.\n- Young leaves turn a pale whitish-grey-green.\n- The ends of mildewed leaves can twist and curl upward.\n- Young shoots can whither and die back.\n- Severe infections cause defoliation.\nFruit\n- White \u2018powdery\u2019 spores develop on the young fruits.\n- Infected fruit fall prematurely.\nSurvival and spread:\nThe fungi produce tiny, powdery spores that can survive on fallen leaves. It can be transported long distances by wind, on people (clothing, hands), equipment (e.g. pruning tools, mechanical harvesters or hedgers) or vehicles.\nFavourable conditions:\n- Cool and damp weather (temp 20\u00b0C) responsible for development of disease in plants\n- Long period of high relative humidity >80% with mists and fog are especially conducive for the development of disease.\nIPM for Citrus\nTo know the IPM practices for Citrus, click here.\nSource: NIPHM and Directorate of Plant Protection, Quarantine & Storage\nLast Modified : 2/19/2020\n0 ratings and 0 comments\nRoll over stars then click to rate.\n\u00a9 C\u2013DAC.All content appearing on the vikaspedia portal is through collaborative effort of vikaspedia and its partners.We encourage you to use and share the content in a respectful and fair manner.

        "html": "Description\nLemon,\nCitrus limon, is a small evergreen tree in the family Rutaceae grown for its edible fruit which, among other things, are used in a variety of foods and drinks. The tree has a spreading, upright growth habit, few large branches and stiff thorns. The tree possesses large, oblong or oval, light green leaves and produces purple-white flowers in clusters. The lemon fruit is an ellipsoid berry surrounded by a green rind, which ripens to yellow, protecting soft yellow segmented pulp. Lemon trees can reach 3\u20136 m (10\u201320 ft) in height and can live for many years, reaching full fruit bearing capacity in approximately 40 years. Lemon may also be referred to as bush lemon or Persian apple and likely originated from the eastern Himalaya of India.\nSeeds inside fruit\nFruit\nLemon tree\nFruit sliced open to reveal flesh\nCluster of lemon fruits\nLemon fruit ripening on tree\nUses\nDue to their bitter taste, lemon fruit is not usually consumed fresh. It is used widely to make juices such as lemonade, as garnishes in cooking and as a flavoring in cooking and baking.\nPropagation\nRequirements\nLemon is a subtropical plant and the trees grow best in regions with a pronounced change in season. They will grow best at temperatures between 26\u201328\u00b0C (79\u201382\u00b0F) and are very sensitive to cold. Trees and fruit will be damaged or killed by freezing conditions without protection.The trees will tolerate drought conditions but perform poorly in water-logged soil. Trees will grow best when planted in a well-draining sandy loam with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. Soil must be deep enough to permit adequate root development. Lemon trees will grow best when positioned in full sunlight.\nBudding\nBudding should be carried out when seedling stems have reached roughly the diameter of a pencil (6\u20139 mm/0.25\u20130.36 in) and at a time when the bark of the rootstock tree is slipping (this is the term used to describe a period of active growth when the bark can be easily peeled from the plant). Twigs (budwood) should be collected from the previous growth flush or the current flush so long as the twig has begun to harden. The twigs should have well developed buds and should be as close as possible to the diameter of the rootstock onto which it will be joined. It is extremely important to only collect budwood from disease-free trees. The use of diseased budwood can cause the spread of many serious citrus diseases which can kill trees. The budwood to be used for propagation should be trimmed to create budsticks which are 20\u201325 cm (8\u201310 in) by removing any unwanted wood and leaves. These budsticks can be stored for 2\u20133 months under the correct conditions but it is best to use them as soon as possible after cutting.\nThe simplest way to join the budwood the the rootstock is by T-budding. The area to be joined should be pruned to remove any thorns or twigs and the cut made approximately 15 cm (6 in) from the ground. Using a sharp knife, a 2.5\u20133.8 cm (1\u20131.5 in) vertical cut should be made in the stem of the rootstock, through the bark. A horizontal cut should be made at either the top or the bottom of the vertical cut to produce a \u201cT-shape\u201d The horizontal cut should be made a slightly upward-pointing angle and should reach through the bark. Remove a bud from a budstick by slicing a thin, shield-shaped piece of bark and wood from the stem, beginning about 1.25 cm (0.5 in) above the bud. This piece should measure 1.9\u20132.5 cm(0.75\u20131.0 in) in length. Immedietely insert the piece of bud into the cut on the rootstock by sliding it under the opened bark so that the cut surface lies flat against the wood of the rootstock plant. Finish the join by wrapping the bud with budding tape.\nAfter the union has formed and the tape is removed, the bud is forced to grow by cutting the rootstock stem 2.5\u20133.9 cm (1.0\u20131.5 in) above the join about 2/3 of the way through the stem on the same side as the join. The top of the seedling should then be pushed over towards the ground. This process, known as \u201clopping\u201d allows all of the nutrients to be diverted to the bud Once the bud begins to grow and reaches several inches in lengthe, the lop can be removed completely from the seedling.\nPlanting seedlings\nLemon trees can be purchased as seedlings which have already been grafted and only require planting in the garden or orchard. The best time to plant citrus trees is in Spring after all danger of frost has passed in your area. Trees should be planted at or higher than the level of the nursery pot. Once the tree is positioned in the planting hole, backfill the soil by about half and water to allow the soil to settle around the lower roots before filling in the hole. The newly planted tree should be watered every few days.\nGeneral care\nNewly planted trees require proper irrigation to ensure they become established. During the first year, water should be applied at the base of the trunk so that the root ball is kept moist to allow the roots to establish in the soil. Newly planted trees should be provided with water every 3\u20137 days. The soil should be moist, but not wet. Trees planted in sandy soils will require water more frequently. Young trees will also require a light application of fertilizer every month in the first year. Lemon trees will need protected from cold temperatures to prevent damage. Soil can be mounded up around the trunk during the winter and removed in the Spring. Young trees can also be protected from frosts by covering them with tarps or blankets as required.\nReferences\nCABI Crop Protection Compendium. (2008). Citrus limon (lemon) datasheet.

Control is therefore reliant on preventing the disease occurring in the first place and this is achieved through strict quarantining to prevent the introduction of citrus psyllids to areas which are currently free of the pest. Areas which are subject to quarantine have restrictions placed on the movement of citrus plants, fruit, equipment and items made from citrus.\nInfected trees should be removed as quickly as possible from plantations and destroyed. Identification of infected trees should be achieved through several surveys to ensure that infected trees which are not yet showing symptoms are identified. In Florida, the recommendation is to scout groves at least 4 times a year for disease symptoms.\n(ii) Control of citrus psyllids\nCitrus psyllid populations can be controlled through the application of chemical sprays. Insecticides have proved very effective at controlling T. eryreae in South Africa where systemic insecticides are applied to the tree at the base of the trunk. In areas of the USA, Citrus health management areas (CHMAs) have been created to encourage neighbouring growers to work together to prevent the disease. Control strategies which have been implemented by the program include scouting, mapping and large-scale spraying to control citrus psyllids.\nCategory : Viral\nTristeza disease\nCitrus tristeza virus (CTV)\nSymptoms\nLight green foliage; poor new growth; leaves may be dropping from tree; young trees blooming early; severely infected trees are stunted and bushy in appearance with chlorotic leaves and brittle twigs; some strains of the virus cause elongated pits in the trunk and branches which give the wood a rope-like appearance.\nCause\nVirus\nComments\nManagement\nQuarantine procedures are used to control tristeza and prevent the pathogen from entering areas which are currently free of the disease.\nPests\nCategory : Insects\nAphids (Black citrus aphid, Brown citrus aphid)\nToxoptera aurantii\nToxoptera citricida\nBrown citrus aphids on leaves\nBrown citrus aphid (Toxoptera citricida)\nSymptoms\nLeaves curling; leaves and twigs covered in sticky substance which may be growing sooty mold; trees may show symptoms of tristeza (see entry); insects are small and soft bodied and are black in color.\nCause\nInsect\nComments\nManagement\nAphid numbers tend to naturally decline as leaves harden off but can be a problem on young trees or varieties which continually produce flushes of new growth; pesticides are not generally recommended due to resistance and trees can withstand a high degree of leaf curling.\nCitrus leaf miner\nPhyllocnistis citrella\nTunneling caused by leaf miner\nCitrus leafminer (Phyllocnistis citrella) damaged leaves\nLeaf curling distortion from citrus leafminer injury\nLeafminer damage\nSymptoms\nThin, winding trails on leaves; heavy infestation can result in curled and distorted leaves; adult leafminer is a tiny moth which lays its eggs in the leaf; larvae hatch and feed on leaf interior.\nCause\nInsect\nComments\nManagement\nInsecticide application are rarely warranted in mature orchards as yields are unaffected; young trees should be treated with appropriate insecticides to prevent retarded growth; cultural control methods include removal of water sprouts from trees and refraining from pruning live branches more than once a year to encourage uniform growth flushes which are short in duration.\nSoft scales (Black scale, Brown soft scale , Citricolla scale)\nSaissetia oleae\nCoccus hesperidum\nCoccus pseudomagnoliarum\nCitricola scale (Coccus pseudomagnoliarum) on leaves\nBrown soft scale (Coccus hesperidum)\nBlack scale (Saissetia oleae)\nBrown soft scale (Coccus hesperidum) adults on citrus stem\nCitricola scale (Coccus pseudomagnoliarum)\nSymptoms\nLeaves covered in sticky substance and may have growth of sooty mold; reduced tree vigor; leaves and/or fruit dropping from plants; presence of black, brown or gray flattened scales on leaves, twigs and/or branches.\nCause\nInsects\nComments\nManagement\nOrganically acceptable methods of control include the application of horticultural oils and preservation of natural enemies.\nThrips\nScirtothrips citri\nSouth African citrus thrips (Scirtothrips aurantii) damaged lime\nCalifornia citrus thrips (Scirtothrips citri)\nSymptoms\nInsect feeds under sepals of young fruit and causes a ring of scarred tissue as the rind expands; adult thrips are orange-yellow in color.\nCause\nInsect\nCitrus thrips\nComments\nManagement\nInsecticide application is rarely required as healthy trees can withstand heavy feeding damage; insecticides can actually promote thrips populations by stimulating reproduction."

        "html": "By Angelo Randaci, Earth\u2019s Ally Horticulturist\nAngelo\u2019s passion for plants has led him to explore many areas of horticulture including research, grounds management, technical training, design and nursery management.\nHow to Identify and Treat Plant Disease\nProtect your plants from debilitating diseases by learning to recognize the symptoms and practice prevention. A wholistic approach includes first identifying the pathogen. Then decide on a treatment method that is safe, effective and responsible. Read on and bookmark this page for plant disease identification.\nBlack Spot\nBlack spot is one of the most common diseases found on roses, but it can also occur on other ornamental and garden plants. This fungal disease causes black, round spots that form on the upper sides of leaves. Lower leaves are usually infected first. Severe infestations cause infected leaves to turn yellow and fall off the plant. Black spot is a problem during extended periods of wet weather or when leaves are wet for 6 hours or more. Black spot spores overwinter in the fallen leaves.\nTips for Controlling Black Spots on Leaves\n- Plant in well-draining soil. Keep your plants healthy by providing regular feedings of organic fertilizer. This will help prevent fungal disease in plants.\n- The fungus spores overwinter in plant debris. Remove dead leaves and infected canes from around the plants and disguard in the trash. Do not add to the compost pile.\n- Disinfect your pruners with a household disinfectant after every use. Ethanol or isopropyl alcohol can be used straight out of the bottle.\n- Because water (not wind) spreads the fungal spores, avoid applying water on the leaves. When you water, apply water directly to the roots. Use a soaker hose to water plants prone to the disease.\nOther Leaf Spots\nFungal leaf spot disease can be found both indoors on houseplants, and outdoors in the landscape. This occurs during warm, wet conditions. As the disease progresses, the fungal spots grow large enough to touch each other. At this point the leaf surface appears more like blotches than spots. Leaf spot may result in defoliation of a plant. Follow the same tips as the ones to control black spot.\nPowdery Mildew\nPowdery mildew is a fungal disease that affects many of our landscape plants, flowers, vegetables and fruits. Powdery mildew is an easy one to identify. Infected plants will display a white powdery substance that is most visible on upper leaf surfaces, but it can appear anywhere on the plant including stems, flower buds, and even the fruit of the plant. This fungus thrives during low soil moisture conditions combined with high humidity levels on the upper parts of the plant surface. It tends to affect plants kept in shady areas more than those in direct sun.\nTips for Controlling Powdery Mildew\n- Inspect plants that you buy from a greenhouse before purchasing for mildew (and insects).\n- Wiping off the leaves is not an effective powdery mildew treatment as it will return within days of cleaning.\n- Because spores overwinter in debris all infected debris should be removed. Trim and remove infected plant parts.\n- Do not till the debris into the soil or use in the compost pile.\n- Space plants far enough apart to increase air circulation and reduce humidity.\nDowny Mildew\nBecause downy mildews differ from powdery mildews, it is important to understand the differences between the two. Powdery mildews are true fungal pathogens that display a white powdery substance on the upper leaves. Downy mildews, on the other hand, are more related to algae and produce grayish fuzzy looking spores on the lower surfaces of leaves. To identify downy mildew, look for pale green or yellow spots on the upper surfaces of older leaves. On the lower surfaces, the fungus will display a white to grayish, cotton-like downy substance. Downy mildew occurs during cool, moist weather such as in early spring or late fall. Spore production is favored by temperatures below 65\u00b0F and with a high relative humidity.\nTips for Downy Mildew Treatment\n- Downy mildew needs water to survive and spread. It there is no water on your leaves, the disease cannot spread. Keep water off leaves as much as possible.\n- Because the disease overwinters on dead plant debris, be sure to clean around your plants in the fall to help prevent the disease in the following spring.\n*Some of the fungicides used to control powdery mildew will not control downy mildew. Earth\u2019s Ally\u2019s fungicide will control both powdery and downy mildew.\nBlight\nPlant blight is a common disease. Remember the potato famine in the 1840\u2019s? As a result of the blight, one million people died. But other than potatoes, blight also affects other plants, particularly tomatoes. Blight is a fungal disease that spreads through spores that are windborne. For this reason, spores can cover large areas and rapidly spread the infection. Blight can only spread under warm humid conditions, especially with two consecutive days of temps above 50\u00b0F, and humidity above 90% for eleven hours or more. No cure exists. Prevention is the only option.\nTips for Preventing Blight\n- If growing potatoes, grow early varieties because blight occurs during mid-summer and you can harvest your crop before the blight.\n- Plant resistant varieties: Sarpo Mira and Sarpo Axona are two varieties that show good resistance. Practice good garden hygiene.\n- Destroy any blight-infected plant parts. Keep the area clean of fallen debris from your diseased plants and discard in the trash. Do not add to your compost pile.\nCanker\nCanker is often identified by an open wound that has been infected by fungal or bacterial pathogens. Some cankers are not serious while others can be lethal. Canker occurs primarily on woody landscape plants. Symptoms may include sunken, swollen, cracked or dead areas found on stems, limbs or trunk. Cankers can girdle branches, and kill foliage. Cankers are most common on stressed plants that have been weakened by cold, insects, drought conditions, nutritional imbalances or root rot. Rodents can also spread the pathogens.\nTips for Controlling Canker in Plants\n- Remove diseased parts in dry weather.\n- Grow resistant varieties whenever possible.\n- Avoid overwatering and overcrowding; avoid mechanical wounds such as damage from lawn mowers.\n- Wrap young, newly planted trees to prevent sunscald. Sunscald creates dead patches that form on trunk and limbs of young trees if the trunks have been shaded, then transplanted to sunny areas.\n- Keep plants healthy by planting in healthy soils and maintaining nutritional requirements.\nTips to Control Plant Fungus and Diseases\nFirst and foremost, build a well-drained soil with plenty of organic matter prior to planting. Raise the beds if necessary and fill the beds with a commercial potting mix that drains well. Soils that hold too much water can cause rotting. Avoid getting water on leaves. Hand water at the root zone or use a soaker hose. Fertilize as necessary to keep plants in peak condition.\n- Choose resistant varieties whenever possible.\n- Prune or stake plants, do not crowd them, and remove tall weeds to improve air circulation.\n- Plants in containers can be placed away from areas that do not receive air circulation.\n- Remove any infected debris to keep the disease from spreading. Remove and place in the trash (not in the compost bin) severely infected plants.\n- Water during early morning hours so the plants can dry out and avoid getting water on the leaves. Water later in the day if downy mildew is present as it favors morning moisture. Either way, avoid getting water on the leaves. A soaker hose will keep water at the root zone and help keep the spores from spreading.\n- Inspect all plants before purchasing from your local greenhouse for disease symptoms and pests.\n- Disinfect pruners after cutting diseased plant parts.\n- Purchase a hand lens. A 10x hand lens is a great way to detect fungus and insect problems. Besides that, a hand lens allows you to see thing in nature difficult to see with the naked eye.\nKeep all parts of the plant protected by using a fungicide for plants. Earth-friendly fungicide spray like plant Disease Control is an OMRI Listed\u00ae contact fungicide and bactericide for use on houseplants and in organic gardens. Formulated with food-grade citric acid, Earth\u2019s Ally is highly effective at treating and preventing the common plant diseases outlined in this article.\nThese steps will build a healthy immune system and help avoid disease (and insect) problems. Diseases and pests tend to attack weak, stressed plants. Think of your immune system. The better it is, the better it will fight disease.\nWe\u2019d love to hear how Earth\u2019s Ally is helping you grow healthy plants.

        "html": "Powdery Mildew\nProblem: Powdery mildew leaves a telltale white dusty coating on leaves, stems and flowers. Caused by a fungus, it affects a number of plants, including lilacs, apples, grapes, cucumbers, peas, phlox, daisies and roses.\nSolution: Rake up and destroy infected leaves to reduce the spread of spores. Also, give plants good drainage and ample air circulation. Avoid overhead watering at night; mid-morning is preferred to allow foliage to dry before evening. Commercial fungicides are available for powdery mildew, or you can spray with a solution of one tsp. baking soda and one quart of water as recommended by George \u201cDoc\u201d and Katy Abraham, authors of The Green Thumb Garden Handbook.\nLilac, a highly aromatic plant, is a common victim of powdery mildew.\nDowny Mildew\nProblem: Downy mildew is caused by fungus-like organisms and affects many ornamentals and edibles, such as impatiens, pansies, columbine, grapevines, lettuce and cole crops such as broccoli and cauliflower. Often occurring during wet weather, downy mildew causes the upper portion of leaves to discolor, while the bottoms develop white or gray mold.\nSolution: Plant resistant cultivars when available. No fungicides are available, but cultural practices can help. Remove and destroy infected foliage, or entire plants if downy mildew is prevalent. Avoid crowding plants or watering them in the evening, and rotate edibles year to year.\nBlack Spot\nProblem: Black spot is a fungal disease commonly found on roses, but also on other flowers and fruits. While it doesn\u2019t kill plants outright, it weakens them and makes them susceptible to other problems. In cool, moist weather, small black spots appear on foliage, which starts to turn yellow and eventually drops off.\nSolution: The fungus overwinters in diseased canes and leaves, so remove both before winter. Keep foliage clean and dry by mulching beneath plants, positioning roses where the morning sun will quickly evaporate dew, and watering at the roots rather than wetting the foliage. Consider planting varieties of roses that are resistant to black spot. Plants also can be sprayed with a fungicide to prevent black spot.\nMosaic Virus\nProblem: There are a number of mosaic viruses, but gardeners are most likely to encounter two: tomato mosaic virus and tobacco mosaic virus. The former infects tomatoes, peppers, potatoes, apples, pears and cherries; the latter infects tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, lettuce, beets, petunias and, of course, tobacco.\nMosaic virus causes mottled yellow and green leaves that are sometimes curled and distorted. Some plants exhibit yellowing, stunted growth, malformed fruits and reduced yield. Mosaic virus is more common in hot weather.\nSolution: There are no chemical controls, but resistant varieties exist. The virus can live in dry soil for some time. Remove and destroy infected plants, roots and all, and avoid planting susceptible plants in the same area for two years. Because tobacco is a carrier, smokers should wash hands thoroughly before handling plants.\nDamping-Off Disease\nProblem: Damping-off disease, caused by several soil-borne fungi, is most problematic in wet, humid conditions. It infects seedlings and causes them to collapse and decay. It\u2019s often found in greenhouses but can occur outdoors as well.\nSolution: There is no treatment, but you can prevent it with good cultural practices. Use new pots, cell packs or trays, or those disinfected with a 10 percent bleach solution. Fill with fresh, bagged, soilless potting mix, avoid crowding seedlings and provide adequate ventilation.\nDamping-off disease usually affects newly-sown plants.\nFusarium Wilt\nProblem: Caused by a soil-borne fungus, fusarium wilt affects ornamental and edible plants, including dianthus, beans, tomatoes, peas and asparagus. The disease causes wilted leaves and stunted plants, as well as root rot and sometimes blackened stem rot. It\u2019s especially active in hot summer temperatures.\nSolution: There are no chemical controls available to home gardeners, but there are disease-resistant cultivars. If fusarium wilt shows up somewhere in the garden, remove and destroy infected plants and do not plant the same species in that spot for five years.\nVerticillium Wilt\nProblem: Verticillium wilt is a fungal disease that affects hundreds of species of trees, shrubs, edibles and ornamentals (see this list of susceptible plants). Pathogens, which can live in the soil for years, make their way into the plant through the roots, eventually clogging the vascular system and causing branches to wilt suddenly and foliage to turn yellow and fall off prematurely. It can also lead to stunted growth.\nSolution: Fungicides are not effective, but good sanitation practices may help. Remove and destroy infected annuals, perennials and edibles. Prune diseased branches off trees and shrubs. (When you do this, you\u2019ll notice a telltale green streak or stain in the wood.) Sterilizing cutting tools with a 10 percent bleach solution between cuts.\nSooty Mold\nProblem: Sooty mold refers to fungi that grow on the sticky deposits, called honeydew, left by plant-sucking insects. On leaves it\u2019s not only unsightly; it impedes photosynthesis and stunts plant growth. Leaves coated with sooty mold also drop off prematurely.\nSolution: To deal with sooty mold, you have to deal with the plant-sucking insects leaving the honeydew, such as aphids, leafhoppers and mealybugs. Spray them with insecticidal soap or neem oil. Ants are attracted to the honeydew for food, so they protect the plant-sucking insects from predatory insects that would otherwise keep a lid on the pest population. Trap ants or, with woody plants, paint a sticky compound such as Tanglefoot around stems.\nSnow Mold\nProblem: Snow mold is a fungus that flourishes in the cold, moist conditions found beneath snow. It attacks turf grass. After snow melts, symptoms become visible: light tan areas of matted grass caused by threads of mold.\nSolution: Rake the matted grass to break up the mold and allow for new growth. In fall, make the last cutting of the year shorter to discourage tall grass blades from falling over and contributing to matting.\nRust\nProblem: Rust, another fungal disease, is easy to spot because it forms rusty spots on leaves and sometimes stems. The spots eventually progress from reddish-orange to black. There are many types of rust that can attack plants such as hollyhocks, roses, daylilies and tomatoes. Even your lawn is susceptible to grass rust.\nSolution: Fungicides are available. Culturally, it\u2019s a good practice to gather and destroy any infected plants to prevent the fungus from overwintering."

        "html": "You work hard to produce quality crops for your community, but diseased plants can affect your livelihood and food stock. By understanding different plant diseases, you can spot signs of infection, treat symptoms and prevent the spread. Here\u2019s how to identify and control these conditions for healthy growth.\nHow Do You Identify a Plant Disease?\nIdentifying plant diseases requires knowing what symptoms to look for. Infections can affect a plant\u2019s growth, function, color and appearance. When you see the warning signs, you can intervene early and treat plants effectively.\nIf you notice signs of disease, you can also take samples of affected areas and send them to a local university or treatment center for lab testing and diagnosis.\nCommon Plant Diseases\nYou can take preventive measures once you know how to identify various plant diseases. Here are some to look for.\n1. Anthracnose\nAnthracnose is a fungal disease that affects plants, trees, fruits and vegetables. It can cause physical symptoms like dark sunken lesions on leaves, flowers, fruits and stems. The fast-spreading fungus also affects developing shoots and leaves.\nFungus on plants, vegetables, fruits and trees is one of the leading causes of anthracnose. This plant disease can proliferate in warm and humid conditions and spread by watering. Anthracnose can affect whole vegetables and kill twigs on trees.\nCommon signs of anthracnose include:\n- Small yellow or brown dots on leaves\n- Dark spots and pink spore masses on fruits\nHere are some tips for treating anthracnose plant disease:\n- Remove and dispose of affected plants.\n- Prune dead wood on trees and dispose of infected leaves.\n- Spray plants with a copper-based fungicide.\n2. Blossom-End Rot\nBlossom-end rot is a calcium deficiency in plants and crops that breaks down the blossom or bottom end of fruiting crops like tomatoes, squash and eggplant.\nProblems that lead to this issue include:\n- Over- or underwatering soil\n- Imbalanced soil pH\n- High sodium levels\n- Plant root damage\n- Excessive nitrogen-heavy fertilizer\nYou can identify blossom-end rot by looking for dark, sunken spots on the bottoms of green, ripening fruits or hollow black or brown bruises that spread to half the fruit.\nTake the following steps to treat affected areas and prevent blossom-end rot from spreading to other developing crops:\n- Trim damaged fruit areas.\n- Test your soil\u2019s calcium.\n- Frequently check your soil pH.\n- Stalk plants while they are developing.\n- Plant calcium-tolerant vegetable cultivators.\n- Add mulch to retain moisture in dry seasons.\n- Avoid overfertilizing soil and use a calcium-dense fertilizer.\n- Water plants consistently and avoid underwatering and overwatering.\n3. Downy Mildew\nDowny mildew is a fungal disease that causes leaves to wither and turn yellow. It can kill leaves but does not affect the plant stems and petioles. Downy mildew can affect crops like basil, watermelon, cucumbers, sunflowers and grapes. This fungus can thrive and spread in humid and warm climates, causing severe crop reduction.\nSigns of downy mildew include:\n- Yellowing and molding in leaves\n- Gray spores on the underside of leaves\n- Yellow mosaic pattern on the upper leaf surface\n- Infected areas turning brown\nTry these downy mildew treatments:\n- Remove and dispose of infected plants.\n- Trim and dispose of infected areas.\n- Prune lower leaves to increase air circulation.\n- Sanitize shears with bleach or alcohol to prevent the spread.\n- Keep plants dry.\n- Keep leaves off the ground.\n- Water plants with a drip-line irrigation system.\n- Add mulch to keep the soil moist.\n4. Early Blight\nEarly blight is a fungal disease that affects tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants and peppers. Rapidly spreading fungal pathogens cause early blight. Wet, humid and rainy conditions like morning dew create the ideal environment for early blight to proliferate.\nSince it\u2019s easy to confuse early blight with septoria and bacterial leaf spot disease, it\u2019s essential to know what symptoms to look for. Signs of early blight can include:\n- Quarter-inch to half-inch brown spots\n- Oval spots on stems and damaged fruit near the stem\n- Dark brown rings on leaves and yellow leaf tissue around the brown spots\nEarly bright can be challenging to cure, and cultural methods can be the best solution.\n- Remove and dispose of infected plant areas as early as possible.\n- Cultivate more tolerant plant variants.\n- Use fertile soil.\n- Irrigate from below and avoid overhead systems.\n- Add mulch to the soil and reduce soil splash.\n5. Mosaic Viruses\nMosaic viruses commonly affect crops like tomatoes, cucumbers and squash, causing yellow, white and dark green spots and streaks on the leaves. Common signs of mosaic viruses include:\n- Blister-like yellow and white molted leaves\n- Stunted plant growth and leaf deformities\nPreventing mosaic viruses is vital, as they can be challenging to cure. You can minimize mosaic virus plant damage with these treatments:\n- Remove and burn or throw out infected plant areas.\n- Sanitize gardening tools with light bleaches to minimize the spread.\n- Monitor surrounding plants.\n6. Powdery Mildew\nPowdery mildew is a white fungal disease affecting plants like squash, melons, tomatoes, roses and legumes. Powdery mildew can form on top of infected leaves. The white mildew spores spread to other plants in the wind. Powdery mildew can stunt plant growth and reduce fruit yield and quality. It thrives in warm, dry and humid climates and primarily affects plants in shady areas.\nSigns of powdery mildew can include:\n- Dusty white leaves\n- White circular spots\n- Mildew on the upper part of leaves\n- Disfigured leaves and buds\nIf your plants become infected, your best option is to prevent the spread. You can use fungicides to help prevent mildew growth.\nTreat powdery mildew by:\n- Removing and safely disposing of infected plant areas like stems and fruit\n- Never composting infected plants\n7. Rust Plant Disease\nRust disease is a fungus that thrives in mild, moist climates, affecting plant health, strength and flower production. Rust disease spores can spread by wind or water and infect other plants.\nRust plant disease may resemble metal corrosion. Warning signs can include:\n- Yellow or white upper leaf spots.\n- Red or orange blisters underneath leaves.\n- Spores forming in spots and leaf distortion.\nRust plant disease treatment\n- Remove and destroy infected plant areas\n- Avoid splashing water plants to prevent the spread\n- Clean dirt in between plants.\n8. White Mold\nWhite mold is a fungal disease affecting numerous plant types like lettuce, beans and peas. White mold fungus can develop in spring and summer and spread to other plants by the wind in cool conditions. Signs of white mold can include:\n- White-soaked stems\n- Wilting stems with tan or dark lesions\nHow to treat white mold:\n- Remove affected plants.\n- Use mulch or plastic to cover the infected ground and prevent spread.\n- Replace infected soil with clean soil.\nControl Plant Disease With CropCare\u00ae Equipment\nKnowing how to treat plant diseases is vital for protecting your plant and crop quality.

        "html": "10 Common Plant Diseases and How to Treat Them\nApr 4th 2024\nGarden diseases take energy from the plants and cause significant damage, leading to wilting, rust, spots on leaves, rotted tissue, moldy coatings, and stunted growth. Seeing your favorite plants look stressed and damaged by diseases can be discouraging. Every gardener has to face the reality of plant diseases. As a gardener, you must know how to identify plant diseases, deal with them, treat them safely, and keep the problems away from your plants.\nThis guide shares the list of 10 common plant diseases to help you identify them and find safe and practical solutions to combat them.\n1. Downy Mildew\nDowny mildew is a fungal disease that causes yellowish spots on the upper portion of leaves and white or gray mold-looking growth on the bottom of leaves. This disease affects many ornamental plants and edibles, including lettuce, cucumbers, grapes, cauliflower, broccoli, and pansies. Downy mildew often occurs during wet weather and rainy conditions.\nSolution: Plant disease-resistant cultivars. If the fungus is prevalent, remove infected leaves or entire plants. Avoid overhead watering and irrigating plants in the evening. Rotate edible crops every year and avoid crowding plants.\n2. Powdery Mildew\nPowdery mildew is a fungal disease that affects many plants, vegetables, flowers, and fruits, including roses, apples, grapes, cucumbers, zucchini, peas, lilacs, and daisies. It is easy to identify. The disease leaves a white powdery substance on leaves, stems, and flower buds. This fungus affects plants more in shady areas than in direct sunlight.\nSolution: Give plants proper drainage and avoid planting in areas with poor air circulation and ample shade. Additionally, you can spray plants with a solution of baking soda and water. If fungus becomes established, remove infected leaves from plants to stop the spores from spreading. Commercial fungicides to treat powdery mildew are also available. For complete plant protection, spray with sulfur-based or copper-based fungicide spray once every ten days from spring to fall.\n3. Black Spot\nBlack spot is a common plant disease affecting roses and other ornamental plants. This disease causes black spots with feathered edges on the upper sides of leaves. Infected leaves turn yellow and fall from the plant. Black spot occurs during long periods of wet weather or when foliage is wet for more than six hours.\nSolution: Plant resistant varieties in well-draining soil. The fungus spores overwinter in fallen leaves, so remove dead and infected leaves around the plants. Don't add them to the compost pile. Spray copper or sulfur-based fungicide in spring and early summer. Disinfect your gardening tools, including pruner, spade, and cultivator. Avoid overhead watering as it can spread the spores. Use a drip line or soaker hose to apply water directly to the plant's roots.\n4. Fusarium Wilt\nFusarium wilt is a fungal disease caused by a soil-borne fungus. It affects edible and ornamental plants, such as potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbers, beans, melons, eggplants, and asparagus. Fusarium wilt is active in hot summers. It causes stunted plants, root rot, stem rot, and wilted leaves that turn brown and dry. Lower leaves show disease symptoms first.\nSolution: Plant disease-resistant cultivars. Once the disease infects a plant, there's no effective treatment. Remove and destroy affected plants immediately, and don't plant the same variety in that area for five years. If possible, replace fusarium-infected garden soil. In addition, keep your garden tools clean.\n5. Verticillium Wilt\nVerticillium wilt is another common and serious fungal disease that affects shrubs, trees, vegetables, and ornamental plants. Pathogens can live in soil for years, entering roots and making their way to the plant. They clog the plant's vascular system and cause branches to wilt suddenly and leaves to turn yellow. A visible sign of this disease is the wilting and dying of young shoots and branches on one side of the tree or plant. Verticillium wilt can also cause stunted growth.\nSolution: Prevention and good sanitation practices will help control this fungal disease because fungicides are not very effective, and there is no cure for an infected plant. Remove and destroy dead plants, including the infected roots and soil, and replant disease-resistant species. Avoid flooding or underwatering on mature trees. Furthermore, sterilizing cutting tools is necessary to prevent disease from spreading. Use alcohol, 10% bleach solution, or Lysol to disinfect tools. If the area is infected with the fungus, avoid planting the same plants in that area for a few years.\n6. Mosaic Virus\nMosaic virus is a group of viral infections that affects many plants. The most common mosaic viruses that gardeners often encounter include tobacco mosaic virus and tomato mosaic virus. These viruses infect tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce, peppers, beets, pears, apples, tobacco, and many other plants. Mosaic viruses cause mottling and discoloration of leaves in infected plants, which are also curled and distorted. The virus is most prevalent in hot conditions. Some plants lead to stunted growth, yellowing, and malformed fruits.\nSolution: Viral infections have no efficient control, but some resistant varieties exist. Remove infected plants immediately to prevent disease spread. The mosaic virus can survive in the soil for some period. Therefore, avoid planting sensitive plants in the same spot for at least two years.\n7. Rust\nRust is another common fungal disease caused by more than 5,000 fungi species. It commonly affects tomatoes, beans, roses, daylilies, hollyhocks, and snapdragons. The fungi first appear as white spots on the lower side of stems and leaves. These spots then become orange and reddish bumps that turn yellow-green and black. The fungus spreads to the top of the leaves, causing them to turn yellow and fall off. Most spores of rust species thrive in moist environments.\nSolution: Plant resistant varieties. Fungicides are available to control the disease. It is good to destroy infected parts when you see the first sign of disease and spray plants with sulfur or copper-based fungicides every ten days.\n8. Root Rot\nRoot rot decays the roots of plants and trees. It is caused by poor drainage and overwatering. This decaying plant disease shortens the life of plants or trees. The symptoms include wilting, poor growth, thinning, and dieback in the entire plant.\nSolution: Avoid overwatering and plant in aerated and well-drained soil. Wait for the soil to dry a little between waterings, then water it. Disinfect garden tools after you use them. If a plant or tree is highly infected, remove it to prevent the disease from spreading.\n9. Anthracnose\nAnthracnose is a common plant disease found year-round. The signs of disease usually first appear at leaf edges, yellowing and then falling. This fungal disease causes dark lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits, resulting in crop loss. Spores spread it in water splashed over leaves.\nSolution: Prune infected branches, destroy fallen leaves, and avoid overhead watering to spread disease. Fungicides with the active ingredient chlorothalonil are also available.\n10. Blight\nBlight is a common bacterial disease that attacks potatoes, tomatoes, cherries, apricots, plums, and other plants and trees. It spreads under warm, humid conditions from spring till June. Infected plants develop small sunken black spots. These spots appear on leaves and then drop out to give a hole appearance.\nSolution: Remove and destroy blight-infected plant parts. To maintain a clean garden, promptly remove fallen debris from infected plants and dispose of it in the trash. Copper-based fungicides can also be a valuable tool in preventing future infections.\nThe Bottom Line\nPlant diseases are common, but proper plant care and prevention can reduce their occurrence and spread. Avoid overwatering plants, as it is a frequent cause of fungal disease. Additionally, avoid watering leaves. A drip irrigation system delivers precise water to the plant's roots. Additionally, always use clean and sharp cutting and pruning tools in your garden to prevent plant issues in the future."

        "html": "Rust Fungus: Identify Symptoms to Treat and Control Rust Disease\nLearn how to identify and get rid of rust on plants using proven, organic and natural methods.\nThere are around 8,000 named species of rust diseases, many of them host-specific. Scientists speculate there are many more types of rust diseases in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world that have not been discovered yet. Rust diseases are an important class of plant pathogens that affects many economically important crops, including cereal crops, flowering plants, and ornamental plants. Biologists think rust fungi are very ancient to have had the opportunity to co-evolve with so many plants.\nBecause rust fungi are obligate parasites, they will only live on living plants. The fungi creates a structure called a haustorium out of the fungus cell wall and the plant cell wall, which is where the food from the plant goes to the fungi. Even if the fungus is given all the food it needs, it will not grow in a petri dish without the living plant cell of its plant host. This makes it difficult to grow it in the lab, so there are things scientists just don\u2019t know about it yet.\nRust does not usually kill its plant hosts, but can severely limit the growth of plants and their production of food for people. The Irish potato famine was caused by a species of rust that rotted the potatoes in the ground or in storage into a goeye mess. Not only did many Irish starve, but the influx of the Irish into the United States was also caused by that famine. Rust has contributed to other famines through history.\nWhat is Rust Disease?\nRust disease is an obligate fungal parasite that grows on a wide variety of plants useful to humans. All rust fungi are in the order Pucciniales (formerly Uredinales) although there are many types of individual rust diseases. Most of these types can only grow on one or two species of plant.\nSymptoms of Rust Fungi\nThe signature symptom of rust is the orange, yellow, brown, or red spore masses on the outside of the plant. This color gives the rust fungus its name. These spores appear as raised dots on the leaves or stems of the plant. Some types of rust form galls that then become covered in the spore masses. Rust occasionally forms on blooms.\nSymptoms occur from the ground up. They are usually on the underside of the leaves but may also appear on the top of them. It may cause witches broom growth (redish, twisted stems and leaves), cankers, oozes, and spotted needles. Rust may cause leaves to fall prematurely. If enough of the leaves fall, the plant may die. Plants may be stunted, off color, and weak. Plants that are heavily affected for 2-3 years in a row may die if not treated. A bad case of rust does not leave enough green areas on the leaf for significant photosynthesis to occur, and the plant starves.\nRust may occur on the bark or needles of conifers. It may cause witches broom growth (redish, twisted stems and leaves), cankers, oozes, and spotted needles.\nSome types of turf grass get rust, too. If you walk through the lawn and your shoes have orange dust all over them, you have a rust problem. This is most common in perennial ryegrass, but also effects Kentucky Bluegrass, tall & fine fescues, zoysiagrass, and bermudagrass. You can find rust resistant turfgrass cultivars listed on the National Turfgrass Evaluation Program (NTEP) at www.ntep.com.\nIs Rust Fungus Poisonous to Humans?\nNo, rust fungus is not poisonous to humans or animals. Eating food with rust on it is discouraged because the flavor is often off.\nLife Cycle of Rust Fungus\nRust has a complicated life cycle, but it is important to understand so you know how to interrupt the life cycle and take care of infected plants. Some species of rust go through five stages on two different, unrelated plants. Other species go through fewer life stages and may only infect one plant species.\nThe optimum conditions for a rust infection are when temperatures are between 68-86F and the foliage is wet. The leaf needs to be wet for 6- 10 hours. A rapid increase in temperature and higher light intensity after that is also conducive to infection. This means plants that are wet all through the night, followed by sunrise and warmer temperatures, create ideal conditions for rust infections. We will be using the Puccinia graminis (Wheat stem rust fungus) as an example of rust disease with all five stages and two hosts.\nOn Barberry\nStage 0\nThe basidiospores, made when the overwintering teliospores germinate, infect the barberry plant. They create spermogonia. Each spermogonium has receptive hyphae (female) and spermatia (male). The spermatia have to get to the hyphae to \u201cfertilize\u201d it. The spermogonium produces a sweet nectar substance that flies love. The fly crawls from spermogonium to spermogonium to drink the nectar. She tracks spermatia into hyphae, just like bees track pollen. This is the sexual reproduction stage for the fungus. If this does not happen, the cycle stops.\nAfter the sexual reproduction, aeciospores form and must find a wheat plant to continue the cycle. They are often spread on the wind, then get on the wheat plant when water splashes it up on the leaf.\nOn Wheat\nStage 1\nThe aeciospore lands on a wheat plant leaf or stem. If the weather is mild and the leaf is wet, the rust spore germinates. It then goes through the leaf stoma, or pore, into the plant. Once in, mycelium (fungal threads, or hyphae) starts growing and begins feeding on the plant. Spraying the wheat plants at green-up is an effective way to kill the rust spores when they begin to germinate but before they enter the leaf pore.\nStage 2\nThe mycelium gives rise to uredinia bearing urediniospores. As the urediniospores develop, they burst through the plant\u2019s epidermis, or skin, in the classic rusty-colored spores. These urediniospores can infect nearby wheat plants throughout the spring and summer. They can also reinfect their host plant. This is the most dangerous stage of the plant. Once the urediniospores develop, it is too late to control the fungus until the plant goes dormant in the fall.\nStage 3\nIn late summer, the uredinia convert to telia which bare teliospores. These are the two-celled, thick-walled black spores that will survive the winter. The rusty brown color on the plant begins to change to black as the switch happens. Once the teliospores develop, wait until leaf drop and spray the host plants with a fungicide. This will kill the fungus before it can spread again.\nOn Barberry\nStage 4\nIn the spring, the teliospores germinate into basidia, which make basidiospores. These must infect barberry, not wheat. They are usually transported by the wind. If there are no barberry plants, this type of rust cannot continue growing and dies.\nPreventing Rust Fungus\nIt is very difficult to prevent rust fungus in your garden because it appears in such a wide variety of plants. However, there are some cultural things you can do to lower the chance your plant gets rust.\nBuy rust-resistant cultivars\nNot all plants that get rust have rust-resistant cultivars. When possible, however, you should buy rust-resistant cultivars. Be sure you look for those in seed catalogs. This information is also on the seed packets of resistant varieties. The little tags in potted plants you get from the nursery should have that information on them, too.\nCheck plants before bringing them home\nOnly buy plants from a local and reputable nursery. The plants there will be better quality and less apt to be diseased. Before buying a plant at a nursery, check under the leaves of the plant and around the base of it. If you see any spots on the leaves or stem, don\u2019t buy the plant. Find another plant to purchase. You do not want to introduce rust into your landscape if you can help it.\nQuarantine New Plants\nEven if you do not see any spots on a plant at the nursery, it is a good idea to quarantine new plants for two weeks before placing them in your landscape. There is a point after infection but before the rust spots burst that is not easily detectable. Quarantining the plants gives the rust time to become evident before it spreads to other plants. Most nurseries guarantee their plants, so if they do show the symptoms of rust during quarantine, take the plants back.\nHow to water plants to prevent rust fungus?\nRust fungus must sit on a wet leaf for 6-10 hours before it can infect a plant. Do not use overhead watering to water a plant. Water using drip irrigation or other methods that do not wet the plant leaves, only the roots. Soil splashing up on leaves during watering is a major method of infection.\nSometimes you can\u2019t help but use a sprinkler system. If you must water overhead, do so from 5-10 A.M. so the leaves dry before nightfall.\nDispose of infected plants and plant parts properly.\nNever compost a plant with any disease or pest problem. The problem will be introduced into your compost. When you spread the compost, you spread the disease throughout your landscape.\nPut infected plants and leaves into a plastic bag. Seal it well and put it in the trash. That way, the spores cannot spread to other plants.\nFall Clean-Up\nMake sure you clean up leaves and other dead plant parts from your landscape beds each fall. If you have rust-affected plants, cut them to the ground at the end of the season and remove them from your landscape beds. Rust overwinters on leaves and removing them can cut the rust cycle off. Be sure and do not compost the leaves if your plants have had rust. Dispose of them in plastic bags and put those in the trash.\nRemove Alternate Host Plants\nIn the example of wheat stem rust discussed above, farmers who removed barberry plants saw a drop in rust on their wheat the year following the barberry cull. If you have a rust problem and the rust uses two hosts, remove the less desirable of the two hosts to control the rust problem. This doesn\u2019t work if the rust species you have only uses one host.\nHot Water\nBecause rust can only exist in such a narrow temperature band, hot water kills some types of rust. An example is geranium rust (Puccinia Pelargonii-zones). However, the hot water does some damage to the plant, also.\nWash Tools and Shoes\nRust usually disburses in the wind. However, if you have a plant with rust, make sure you wash your tools and shoes before moving on to the next plant. Spores are tiny and can hitch a ride on your shoes and tools to your other plants. Wash tools in a solution on one part bleach and nine parts water. There are disinfectant solutions you can step in to kill pathogens like rust on your shoes.\nHow do you treat rust fungus?\nIf these cultural controls do not keep your plants safe from rust disease, there are some things you can do. Inspect your plants frequently, especially at the base of the leaves near the soil. If you find symptoms of rust, you can remove the leaf that it appears on. Don\u2019t remove more than 1/3 of the leaves at one time. Once you find rust in a vulnerable species, you will need to treat it to save that plant and others of the same species in your landscape.\nChemical treatments\nChemical fungicides should be used in early spring right when new growth appears on the plant or in the fall after leaf drop. Fungicides are not effective after rust symptoms appear. Chemical fungicides have to be repeated every 4-5 weeks while the temperature and moisture are conducive to the fungus. After the weather warms up, rust cannot reproduce even if it is present in the plant, so you can stop the treatments.\nBefore using a fungicide, be sure the label mentions the name of your plant or family of plants on it. Obey all the directions and warnings on the label. Remember, the label is the law. Wear long sleeves, long pants, and closed-toe shoes to use any chemical, including organic ones. Be sure to change clothes after you use the fungicide so you don\u2019t track it into the house.\nFungicides can be expensive, so determine the value of the plants you want to protect. A very low level of rust in a full landscape can probably be controlled by removing infected leaves without having to use fungicides. If the plant is a high value plant, then it may be worth it to administer a fungicide. The same is true if the alternate host to a rust infecting a high value plant cannot be removed.\nThere are many different synthetic antifungals around. Your Extension agent can recommend some if you want to take that route. If you want to use an organic anti-fungal, you have two choices.\nCopper Fungicides\nCopper fungicides can provide control of some rust fungus, depending on the species of rust. Rust fungus has evolved to display resistance to some fungicides, so contact your Extension agent to find out if the rust you have is susceptible to copper.\nSulfur Fungicides\nSulfur fungicides provide control of rust fungus. As with copper, some rusts may be resistant to this fungicide. Do not apply sulfur after the temperature has warmed up as it will damage the plant.\nSo many different plants are susceptible to rust fungus that most gardeners will see at least one case of these fungal plant diseases. There are many things you can do to protect your plants from rust fungal diseases. When you find rust, remove the infected plant parts, if possible, and dispose of them carefully. Treatments for rust must be used at green-up in the spring or at leaf drop in the fall. By the time symptoms appear, it is too late.\nTreatment\n- Select rust-resistant plant varieties when available.\n- Pick off and destroy infected leaves and frequently rake under plants to remove all fallen debris.\n- Water in the early morning hours \u2014 avoiding overhead sprinklers \u2014 to give plants time to dry out during the day. Drip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep leaves dry.\n- Use a slow-release, organic fertilizer on crops and avoid excess nitrogen. Soft, leafy, new growth is most susceptible.\n- Apply copper sprays or sulfur powders to prevent infection of susceptible plants. For best results, apply early or at first sign of disease. Spray all plant parts thoroughly and repeat every 7-10 days up to the day of harvest.\n- Effectively treat fungal diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis and is approved for organic gardening. Best of all, it\u2019s safe to use \u2014 you can treat and pick crops the same day!\n- Containing sulfur and pyrethrins, Bonide\u00ae Orchard Spray is a safe, one-hit concentrate for insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, apply as a protective spray (2.5 oz/ gallon) early in the season. If disease, insects or wet weather are present, mix 5 oz in one gallon of water. Thoroughly spray all parts of the plant, especially new shoots.\n- Prune or stake plants and remove weeds to improve air circulation. Make sure to disinfect your pruning tools (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.\n- Use a thick layer of mulch or organic compost to cover the soil after you have raked and cleaned it well. Mulch will prevent the disease spores from splashing back up onto the leaves.\n- Burn or bag infected plants after the growing season (see Fall Garden Cleanup). Do NOT compost.\nRecommended Products\nGarden Fungicide\nUse to control a long list of fungal diseases including mildew, rust and scab.\n$9.95Read moreSerenade Garden\nGrow beautiful, disease-free fruits, vegetables and flowers - without chemicals!\nRead more"

This technique has been utilized for decades in the agricultural industry to produce disease-free plants, increase crop yields, and create new varieties. The process involves taking small samples of plant tissue from any part of the plant, such as leaf or stem, and growing them in a sterile environment on nutrient-rich media. The resulting plants are genetically identical to the parent plant, disease-free, and healthy.\nThe technique has extensive applications in the horticulture, agriculture, and other plant areas to produce disease-free plants or create hybrids of desired characteristics. Further, the technique is also exploited in labs to study plant growth and development or their secondary compounds.\nIn this article, we will explore the ways in which plant tissue culture is being used to combat plant diseases and the potential benefits it can bring to the agricultural industry.\nAnd, the exciting thing is that the article is also featured on www.Porch.com as part of their expert interview series on plant care and gardening. So, if your want to learn more about indoor gardening and learn about other experts' opinion on the topic, along with me, check out this link!\n5 Common Plant Diseases\nIf you have an indoor houseplant, chances are you have experienced at least one plant disease. This is why you must be checking your plants consistently, as these can rapidly spread and cause a significant problem that, if gone too long, can be hard to come back from.\nHere are some of the most common indoor plant diseases that you should be checking for often and how to treat them:\nPowdery Mildew\nPowdery mildew is a fungal disease that causes a powdery white or gray coating on leaves and stems. This one usually starts as circular, powdery white spots, which can appear on leaves, stems, and sometimes fruit. It can be treated by removing affected leaves and applying a fungicide. It is good practice to isolate the plant while in treatment and quarantine!\nRoot Rot\nRoot rot is caused by overwatering or poor drainage, which leads to the decay of the plant's roots. It can be treated by improving soil drainage and reducing watering. A great way to improve drainage is adding mediums to the soil, like organic perlite and bark. If that still does not work, add watered-down hydrogen peroxide to help aerate the soil. - But truthfully, the best remedy is to stop watering your plants so often! Each plant has different needs, but for the most part, as a good rule of thumb, you can just wait for the soil to be dry between waterings and then give them a good soak!\nSpider Mites\nSpider mites are tiny spider-like pests that can cause yellowing or stippling of leaves; spider mites love an arid environment, so under-watering your plants is usually the leading cause. They can be treated by hosing the plant with water or using a pesticide specifically formulated for spider mites. Quarantine the plant until you are confident these are gone, or the rest of your plants can quickly become infected.\nFusarium\nFusarium is a fungus that causes wilting and yellowing of leaves, often accompanied by brown or black spots. The fungus thrives in warmer weather (optimal soil temp 82\u00b0F) and is more severe in acidic soil. The pathogen often enters through root wounds caused by cultivation or nematode feeding. Solarization kills off the fungus by raising that temperature to an extreme temperature where no fungus can survive. You will want to remove all infected plants from the infected soil and burn or discard them entirely.\nBlack Spot\nBlack spot is caused by a fungus that produces circular black spots on leaves, which can cause defoliation. It can be found on flowers, fruits, and leaves and is problematic when the weather is hot and humid. It can be treated by removing affected leaves and applying a fungicide.\nIdentifying the specific disease or pest affecting your plant is essential to treat it effectively. An effective way to eliminate these plant diseases is through plant tissue culture.\nWhat is Plant Tissue Culture?\nPlant tissue culture is a powerful tool for producing disease-free plants because it allows for the propagation of plants in a controlled, sterile environment. This helps to eliminate pathogens that may be present in the original plant tissue and ensures that the new plants grown from the tissue culture will be disease-free.\nThe following steps can be taken to get rid of indoor plant diseases using plant tissue culture:\n1. Isolation: The first step is to isolate healthy tissue from the infected plant. This can be done by taking small pieces of leaf or stem tissue free from disease symptoms.\n2. Sterilization: The isolated tissue is then sterilized to remove any pathogens that may be present. This can be done by treating the tissue with a bleach solution or other sterilizing agent.\n3. Culture initiation: The sterilized tissue is then placed on a culture medium, a nutrient-rich solution that supports the growth of the tissue. The culture medium is typically supplemented with hormones to promote cell division and growth.\n4. Culture maintenance: The tissue culture is then maintained in a controlled environment, such as a growth chamber, to promote the growth of new plantlets. The culture medium and conditions are carefully monitored to ensure optimal growth.\n5. Acclimatization: Once the new plantlets have grown to a suitable size, they are transferred to a new environment, such as a greenhouse or outdoor setting, to acclimatize them to normal growing conditions.\n6. Planting out: Finally, the plantlets are planted in the soil and grown to maturity. They are now disease free.\nIt is important to note that plant tissue culture is a complex and technical process that requires specialized equipment and expertise. It is best to consult with a plant tissue culture expert professional like our experts at Plant Cell Technology. Or join the next tissue culture master class to learn the ins and outs about plant tissue culture and start up your own lab regardless of the size, whether at home, or at large-scale!\nIn conclusion, plant tissue culture is a powerful tool in the fight against plant diseases. By producing disease-free plants, it can help to increase crop yields and improve the overall health of our food systems. The ability to create new plant varieties with specific traits, such as resistance to disease, can help to ensure the sustainability of our food supply.\nHowever, it is worth noting that plant tissue culture is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and there may be limitations to its use. Ultimately, a combination of techniques, including plant tissue culture, traditional breeding methods, and integrated pest management, will likely be necessary to effectively combat plant diseases.\nBlog Categories\nView by Level\nPopular Blogs\nMaintaining a Clean Tissue Culture Lab Setting Using Aseptic Techniques\nIntroduction to Aspetic Technqiues Don\u2019t even think about getting any success in tissue culture when you aren\u2019t serious about keeping a clean...\nRead MoreExploring Somatic Embryogenesis: Techniques and Applications\nWhat Is Somatic Embryogenesis?

These diseases can pose a threat to their health, endangering everything from houseplants to gardens, or entire crops. Being able to identify the symptoms of these diseases is crucial in preventing their spread and minimizing the damage to your plants. Recognizing plant diseases in their early stages will allow for more successful treatment. For additional tips on maintaining a healthy garden, visit our Foliar Spray Guide.\nUnderstanding Plant Diseases\nPlant diseases are typically grouped into three broad categories: fungal, bacterial, and viral. They may be triggered by a variety of factors, such as environmental conditions. Humidity, temperature fluctuations, and soil conditions can all contribute to the development of disease. Poor hygiene practices, such as using contaminated tools or reusing infected soil are also common vectors for the spreading of disease. Prevention strategies include sanitizing tools and containers, and environmental management techniques such as avoiding overhead watering and providing proper ventilation. Learn more about plant care on our homepage.\nIdentifying Common Plant Diseases\nFungal diseases are among the most common ailments in plants, including powdery mildew, and root rot. Some of the symptoms to watch for include powdery white spots on the leaves, wilting, and decayed roots. Avoiding overhead watering and proper ventilation can help to prevent the spread of fungal diseases. Discover our solutions for fungal diseases in our product range.\nBacterial diseases can be grouped into categories based on their symptoms and the amount of damage they cause, such as vascular wilt, necrosis, soft rot, and tumours. Regular inspection of your plants may reveal signs of bacterial infection, such as leaf discolouration, wilting, and cankers on the stems. When these symptoms are noticed, the affected plant parts should be removed to prevent further spread.\nViral diseases include mosaic virus and yellow leaf curl. These diseases can result in distorted leaves and stunted growth and can be difficult to treat, making it important to monitor your plants. With early detection, you can isolate the affected plants to help prevent viral spread. Learn about our innovative solutions at Foliar Innovation.\nTreatment Strategies\nEach type of disease has its own best course of treatment:\n- Treating Fungal Diseases: Both organic and chemical methods are suitable treatment options for fungal diseases. Organic treatments include neem oil and copper fungicides. Chemical fungicides may provide quicker results than organic ones, but they should be used sparingly to minimize the impact on the environment.\n- Treating Bacterial Diseases: Bacterial diseases may be managed through the use of antibacterial sprays containing copper compounds or antibiotics. Some other methods that can inhibit the spread of bacterial disease include pruning infected plant parts and improving ventilation and air circulation.\n- Treating Viral Diseases: When it comes to viral diseases, the best approach typically involves prevention. Consider using disease-resistant plant varieties and controlling vectors that can transmit pathogens, such as insects. A plant that has been infected should be removed to limit the spread of the disease.\nIntegrated Disease Management\nIntegrated disease management is a holistic approach that combines multiple strategies to manage and control diseases in plants, including the following:\n- Cultural Practices: Cultural practices promote plant health and resilience through methods such as proper watering techniques, adequate spacing between plants, planting disease-resistant varieties, and regular sanitation of gardening tools.\n- Chemical Controls: Chemical controls such as fungicides and bactericides are used when necessary to help manage plant diseases, but care should be taken to follow all label instructions. When possible, alternative methods should be considered to reduce the environmental impact.\n- Biological Controls: Biological controls include beneficial microbes and natural predators to suppress organisms that spread disease. For example, aphid populations can be controlled through the introduction of ladybugs.\nDefending Your Plants Against Disease\nUnderstanding the different types of disease and how to treat or prevent them helps you to promote overall plant health. Early detection along with integrated disease management is your essential component of a plant disease management plan.

        "html": "Most Common Plant Diseases and Solutions\nThese are the diseases Art\u2019s staff get asked about most frequently.\nGeneral Disease Information:\nHealthy plants are more able to resist disease. The cool moist spring and fall weather in the Fraser Valley is ideal for the spread and development of plant diseases. Space plants so there is good air circulation all around them to prevent disease development. Available disease control products are all protectants, which means they must be applied before the problem occurs. Follow label directions on the label of all fungicides.\n1. Powdery Mildew\nMost powdery mildew are very host specific, mildew on cucumbers will not infect roses. Look for white, powdery growth on leaves and shoots. Warm days and cool nights are ideal for powdery mildew development. Particularly susceptible: roses, maples, gooseberries, phlox, nine bark, hascaps, lupines, lilacs, sage, squash and cucumbers.\nPowdery Mildew Control\nPlant disease resistant varieties. Avoid planting in shady areas or areas with poor air circulation. To be effective, a fungicides spray program must start before mildew is well established. A dormant spray of lime sulfur will reduce overwintering fungus on twigs. If mildew does become established, remove and destroy infected leaves. For complete protection of your plant spray with copper-based or sulfur-based fungicide Spray every 10 days from spring through to the fall.\nDid you Know?\nIf you\u2019re growing fruit or vegetables, powdery mildew can cripple flowers and sometimes cause unsightly damage to the crop. If you apply a one spray to fruit trees just before bloom, one more just after bloom and another two weeks later, most damage from this disease will be prevented.\n2. Black Spot\nThis is a common fungal disease of roses. Look for circular, smudged edged black spots with fringed margins. Severely affected leaves yellow and bloom size may be reduced.\nBlack Spot Control\nPlant resistant varieties. During the growing season, remove and dispose of infected leaves and avoid splashing leaves when watering. Roses that flower on current season\u2019s growth should be pruned back hard before growth starts in the spring to remove infected shoots. In spring and early summer apply a spray of sulfur or copper-based fungicide. Apply this treatment at 1 to 2 week intervals through the growing season periodically alternating the fungicide used.\n3. Bacterial Canker or Blight\nThis is a bacterial disease of cool, wet weather areas that attacks cherries, peaches plums, apricots and related trees. It spreads readily from early spring till June when the weather warms up on the West Coast. Most large cherry trees in the Fraser Valley are infected with this disease. It spreads readily in splashing rain from infected trees killing buds, blossoms and twigs often accompanied by gumming when it rains. Infected cherry fruit develop numerous small sunken black spots. Small black spots may appear on leaves, later dropping out to leave a shot hole appearance.\nBacterial Canker or Blight Control\nThere are no resistant cultivars. Prune out dead twigs and cankers on large branches cutting 40 cm below the diseased area. Only prune during dry weather to avoid spreading the disease. Sprays of copper-based fungicide should help prevent future infections. Make the first application prior to fall rains in September, repeat at leaf drop and again twice more before the buds open in the spring.\n4. Shot Hole\nShot Hole is also called Coryneum Blight in the Interior of BC. This disease of peach, apricot, plum and cherry spreads in warm wet weather infecting buds, blossoms, leaves, fruit and twigs (not large branches). Leaves develop numerous small, tan to purplish spots about 6 mm in diameter that drop out causing a shot hole appearance. Red to purplish spots also form on the fruit and can be accompanied by a clear, gummy substance. Gummy twig and small branch cankers also occur.\nShot Hole Control\nplant resistant varieties. Rake up and destroy fallen leaves and prune out and destroy infected twigs and branches. To prevent twig and bud infections spray with Copper Spray: Peaches after harvest and all other trees in September before fall rains start.\n5. Black Knot\nThis fungal disease of plums causes wart-like growths on twigs and branches. New knots appear mid-summer on small twigs. The knots can grow to a diameter of 15 to 20 cm and may girdle branches. The knots turn black in the fall.\nBlack Knot Control\nJapanese plums are more resistant than European plums. Before February 1 of each year, prune out the knots cutting at least 10 cm beyond the knots and dispose of them. Spores from old knots infect new shoots in the early part of the of the growing season. Sprays of lime sulfur during the dormant season and wettable sulfur at full bloom and petal drop may reduce the number of new infections.\n6. Rust\nrusts are fungal diseases that only infect specific plants. Most rusts start out as small orange, red or brown spots on the underside of leaves (sometimes stems) changing to brown in the summer. Particularly susceptible plants include: Hollyhock, heuchera, daylilies, pears, Rhododendrons and Juniper.\nDid you know? Juniper is an obligatory alternate host for the rust that infects pears. To prevent this disease, plant either pears or Juniper, not both unless they are more than 30 meters apart.\nThe rusts that infects rhododendrons, Hollyhock, daylilies and hechera do not have an alternate host.\nRust Control\nPlant resistant cultivars. At first sign of the disease, remove infected leaves and start spraying plants every 10 days with a copper or sulfur-based fungicide.\n7. Late Blight / Early Blight\nLate Blight and Early Blight these are fungal diseases of tomatoes, potatoes and other related plants. Early blight appears as dark brown to black leaf spots with concentric rings. Black spots develop on stems and large, black, leathery, sunken spots on the fruit. Infections often occur in May or June in wet years. Late blight forms irregular greenish black, water soaked blotches first on older leaves or stems quickly spreading to the fruit. This disease usually doesn\u2019t appear until August in wet years, but it can destroy entire plants overnight.\nLate Blight and Early Blight Control\nSpace and prune plans for good air circulation. Avoid overhead watering. If Early blight starts to appear, pick off and destroy the infected leaves. If chemical control is required apply a copper spray at 7 to 10 day intervals. If late blight starts to appear remove diseased leaves or entire plants immediately, seal in a plastic bag and send to the landfill. Do not compost late blight infected plants. Apply a copper spray at every 5 to 10 days till allowed days before harvest.\n8. Apple Scab\nApple Scab is a common fungal disease in the Fraser Valley. Early leaf infections appear as small green spots with feathery margins that turn brown or black. Severely infected leaves turn yellow and drop early. Fruit infections are circular and brown to black in color and become corky in appearance. This disease over winters on the old leaves that have fallen to the ground.\nApple Scab Control\nPlant resistant apple cultivars such as Liberty, Florina and Bramley\u2019s seedling (partially resistant). Prune mature trees to allow good air circulation. Rake up and destroy fallen leaves to reduce the overwintering fungus. If you have susceptible apple varieties several fungicide sprays are required: the first at bud break; second, just before bloom; third, one week after bloom; and another two weeks later. Use sulfur-based fungicides - lime sulfur or wettable sulfur.\n9. Botrytis Blight or Grey Mold\nBotrytis Blight or Grey Mold is a grey fuzzy mold develops on dead and dying plant tissue spreading to healthy tissue when conditions are wet. Infections first appears as water soaked spots or areas on soft or senescent foliage, flower parts and young stems. On flowering plants, woody ornamentals and small fruit this disease can cause flower, leaf and shoot blights as well as stem and fruit rots. Very susceptible plants include: peonies, roses, hostas, strawberries and raspberries.\nBotrytis Blight or Grey Mold Control\nPlant resistant cultivars. Thoroughly clean and discard garden debris and refuse in the fall to reduce the level of grey mold in your garden. Susceptible plants (that are sun loving) should be grown in sunny areas with good air circulation. If practical water at the base of plants not over the foliage. If botrytis appears, remove infected leaves and fruit. It is rarely worth applying fungicides to control this disease.\n10. Peach Leaf Curl\nPeach Leaf Curl is a fungal disease that is very common on peaches nectarines in high rainfall areas such as the West Coast. In late winter or very early spring, peach leaf curl infects the leaves before the trees start to grow. Infected buds produce leaves with a reddish, thick and curled growth.\nPeach Leaf Curl Control\nNo peach varieties are immune but \u201cFrost\u201d, \u201cPacific Gold\u201d and \u201cRenton\u201d are partially resistant and red Haven has some tolerance. Avoid infection by planting and training trees under the eaves of buildings or other areas protected from rain. Spray all peach trees in with lime sulfur (can be mixed with dormant oil to provide insect control) in February before the trees start to grow. A further spray of a copper-based fungicide applied in September will provide further control.\n11. Verticilium Wilt\nVerticilium Wilt is a serious fungal disease of many deciduous trees, herbaceous perennials, berries and vegetables. It is of particular concern for flowering cherries. It enters roots from the soil moving upwards in the plant, plugging up the plants transportation system. Visible indication that there is a problem starts with yellowing, wilting and dying back of young twigs and branches often on one side of plant or tree. Many other problems look the same, however Verticillium wilt gets worse from year to year. Cutting into a woody stem with a knife reveal black or brown streaks in the wood are vascular cambium just under the bark.\nVerticilium Wilt Control\nControl is all preventative as there is no cure once a plant is infected. Avoid drought stress or flooding on mature landscape trees. Remove dead and dying plants including the infested roots and the soil and replant with tolerant or resistant species. When pruning trees that may have this disease, sterilize your pruning tools between trees to prevent spreading it to an and noninfected tree. Rubbing alcohol, Lysol or a 10% household bleach solution (corrosive) can be used to disinfect pruning tools. Once an area is infected with Verticilium Wilt, we generally suggest not planting the same species in that area for several years.\nOrganic Disease Control Products\nBordo Copper Spray\nfor Powdery Mildew, Bacterial Canker, Rust, Late Blight/Early Blight, Peach Leaf Curl\nGarden Sulfur\nfor Powdery Mildew, Black Knot, Rust, Apple Scab\nEarth Lime Sulfur\nfor Powdery Mildew Black Knot, Rust, Apple Scab, Peach Leaf Curl\nSafers 3 in 1 Garden Spray (w Sulfur and Soap)\nPowdery Mildew, Black Knot, Rust, Apple Scab\nThere are also chemical based plant disease controls, but they may or may not be usable in your Municipality depending on policy and legislations.

        "html": "Crop Diseases: Types, Control, And Prevention\nPlant diseases are a severe threat to the entire production. Therefore, it is essential for farmers to effectively deal with them and check them with the help of timely prevention. Depending on the agricultural area size, this task can be difficult, especially since the list of harmful crop diseases is quite impressive. Modern technologies come to the aid of farmers. EOSDA Crop Monitoring allows you to identify dangerous areas and apply an individual approach to yield treatment, significantly increasing disease control effectiveness.\nTypes Of Crop Diseases & Their Causal Agents\nTraditionally, there are several types of crop disease: abiotic (also known as non-infectious) and biotic (infectious).\nUnfavorable environmental conditions often generate non-communicable diseases. Examples are low or high temperature, excess, or lack of moisture. Also, diseases are usually caused by harmful impurities in the air. They can accumulate due to the presence of nearby chemical or metallurgical plants. Usually, the unhealthy physicochemical composition of the soil is the disease source. The latter factor is often the result of poor-quality treatment of fields with some herbicides. These examples prove the importance of sustainable agriculture not only for protecting the environment but also for a profitable business.\nEven an unfavorable light regime can cause negative consequences, especially for plants produced in greenhouses. Toxins that some embryophytes (higher plants) and fungi release into the soil can also be causal agents of crop diseases.\nAs the crop disease triangle shows, \u0430 disease will take place if there is a crop susceptible to a certain pathogen agent and the conditions are favorable for a disease to spread.\nThe plant must be a pathogen\u2019s host, meaning that pathogens don\u2019t attack non-host plants. For example, Pseudomonas syringae pv. Glycinea threatens growing soybeans causing bacterial blight, while bacterial leaf spot on peppers and tomatoes occurs due to Xanthomonas campestris pv. Vesicatoria infections. It should be mentioned that healthy crops, as well as resistant cultivars and pre-treated seeds, are less susceptible to crop diseases.\nWe will consider relevant crop diseases and their causative agents in the following sections.\nCrop Diseases Caused By Bacteria\nAmong the most common infections in agriculture are crop diseases caused by bacteria. In this regard, the prevention and control of this kind of disease are pretty tricky.\nTo infect the causal agent needs to get into the culture\u2019s tissue. It occurs mainly through damaged areas, such as caused by agricultural tools, insects (fleas), or simply unfavorable weather conditions (dust, wind, heavy rain). But bacteria can also infect plants through natural holes or glands (for example, which secrete nectar).\nAnother feature of bacterial crop diseases is that causal agents, once in a plant or soil, can remain dormant for a long time until favorable conditions arise for them. First of all, significant temperature fluctuations and high levels of humidity act as catalysts for bacterial activity.\nSymptoms Of Bacterial Crop Diseases\nThe main bacterial disease indications include vascular wilting, necrosis, soft rot and tumor.\nAlthough this type of plant disease can be identified due to its pronounced symptoms, identifying a specific causal agent requires laboratory methods.\nCommon Bacterial Diseases\nAs noted earlier, due to a huge number of bacteria, there are many disease types. Here are some examples of the most common diseases of crop plants:\n- Granville wilt exposes itself in growth retardation, wilting of the high culture\u2019s part, and the death of roots.\n- Fire blight symptoms include necrotic weeping ulcers, wilting and rolling of leaves, while the dried parts of a plant do not fall off.\n- Wildfire of tobacco is widespread in the world and shows itself as yellowish-green spots on leaves.\n- Blight of beans affects leafage with yellow-greenish spots, either localized or systemic. The discolored parts may turn necrotic.\n- Aster yellows can be noticed on most vegetables and weeds through malformations and chlorosis.\nMeasures of Bacterial Disease Control\nIt is complicated to control bacterial diseases of crop plants for several reasons: high spreading rate and protection from exposure to chemicals due to being inside the plants. Preventive measures may include using pathogen-free seeds produced in drought-prone regions, hot water for seed treatment, soil solarization, control of plant diseases with germicidal compounds of seeds.\nAlso, crop diseases can be prevented by spraying. Of course, sanitary measures are imperative, which include weed control, sterilization of tools, proper waste disposal, and avoidance of cultivation under conditions when leaves are wet.\nCrop Diseases Caused By Fungi\nPathogenic fungi are the most typical agricultural problem. According to research, this plant disease type destroys about a third of all food crops every year. In this regard, this problem is severe both from a humanitarian and economic point of view. Like bacterial crop diseases, these infections affect plants mainly through wounds, stomata, and water pores. Also, fungal spores are often carried by gusts of wind.\nSymptoms Of Fungal Crop Diseases\nOften, a fungal infection is expressed in local or general necrosis. Also, crop diseases caused by fungi can interfere with the average growth or contribute to its abnormal burst, called hypertrophy. Other crop diseases symptoms include:\n- spots on leaves;\n- exfoliation;\n- rot;\n- anthracnose;\n- ulcers;\n- curls of leaves and warts.\nCommon Fungal Diseases\nThe list of crop diseases caused by fungi is pervasive, so that we will limit ourselves to just a list of some of the most common examples of crop plant diseases:\n- Late blight of potato is expressed by dark green, purple or black lesions with white mold around the edges.\n- Black stem rust of wheat is a dangerous disease that mainly affects cereals. It is expressed in the appearance of rust-colored sori on a plant.\n- Symptoms of Coffee rust are powdery yellow-orange spots with a brown center on the lower part of leaves.\n- Corn smut reveals abnormal formations of various sizes on different corn plant parts, including stalks, leaves, ears, and tassels.\n- Loose smut typically affects grasses like barley, oats, or wheat and is diagnosed through atypical olive-green heads due to the presence of fungi spores.\n- Powdery mildew looks like powder cover on plants (from trees to grasses) that are typically grey or white. First, the crop disease shows spots on leaves but spreads to larger areas as it develops.\n- Anthracnose of grape shows black round spots on foliage leading to its chlorosis and falling. Anthracnose of grape can also damage stems and fruits.\n- Fusarium wilt of tomato results in slowed plant development, foliage wilting, black stripes, and eventually entire plant decay.\n- Botrytis cinerea (gray mold) infects many crops, causing brownish blotches that later develop fuzzy mold on different plant parts.\nFungal Disease Management\nPreventive measures to check crop plant diseases caused by fungi are pretty varied. Key management actions include destroying plant matter containing dangerous fungi, using healthy seeds, regular crop rotation, chemical, and biological fungicides.\nEOSDA Crop Monitoring\nPerforming fields analytics based on relevant satellite data to ensure effective decision-making!\nCrop Diseases Caused By Nematodes\nNematodes are parasitizing plants roundworms, which usually cannot be seen without special equipment. They live in the soil, and therefore mainly affect roots, tubers, and bulbs. There are over 4100 dangerous nematode species .\nSymptoms Of Nematode Crop Diseases\nEssentially, nematodes feed by sucking juices from plants. Because of this, plants affected by these parasites often appear dried out, as if they are suffering from drought. Other symptoms are also similar:\n- yellowing;\n- growth retardation;\n- lack of response to fertilizers and water;\n- the gradual general decline of a plant;\n- reduction or even destruction of root systems.\nCommon Nematode Diseases\nDiseases directly depend on the type of nematodes:\n- Fusiform thickening of the stems is provoked by stem worms. The disease is expressed in the deformation of leaves, swelling of petioles, and the appearance of dark spots on tubers.\n- Aphelenchoides, a disease of rice, is provoked by Aphelenchoides besseyi. Disease marks are blemishes on the tops of leaves, lack of grains, and culture depletion.\n- Tylenchulus semipenetrans cause serious citrus diseases. It is characterized by the gradual death of not only leaves but also branches.\n- Root-knot nematodes cause swelling-like malformations on roots of more than 2000 host species including fruit trees, strawberries, vegetables, or cotton.\n- Root-lesion nematodes destroy plant roots. These pests are often an indirect cause of root rots because the lesions they make are a favorable environment for pathogenic fungi and bacteria.\n- Golden nematode seriously threatens potato fields and reveals tiny golden spots on plant roots, which are nematode cysts with up to 500 eggs.\nControl Of Nematode Diseases\nParasite control involves a wide range of activities. In particular, crop rotation, improving crop disease resistance, and soil treatment with appropriate fumigants with nematicides are effective measures. You can also destroy nematodes and their eggs with hot water (about 50\u00b0C/120\u00b0F). However, this method of controlling crop diseases requires accuracy. You should adjust the watering time according to the temperature to not harm the plants themselves. Measures that promote plant growth are practical against individual nematodes: heavy mulch, fertigation, watering in drought, and summer and autumn fallow.\nCrop Diseases Caused By Virus\nThe most minor but most critical plant enemies are viruses and viroids (subviral contagious agents). After infection, it is almost impossible to save a plant. Therefore the effect of plant diseases on crop production is of critical importance throughout the world. In most cases, the infection spreads as a result of healthy plants with sick contact. Viruses can also spread through vegetative reproduction, through seeds, pollen, and insects. But viruses most often spread through the soil.\nSymptoms Of Viral Crop Diseases\nThe symptoms of crop diseases caused by virus are usually divided into four types:\n- malformations, such as abnormal growth of shoots, distortion of leaves and flowers;\n- necrosis, wilting and the appearance of annular stripes and spots;\n- dwarfism, growth retardation of both individual parts and the whole plant;\n- discoloration, e.g. yellowing, and vein clearing.\nRoot crop diseases, which are expressed in their rotting, are a characteristic indication of the presence of a virus. However, some plants may not show symptoms and are latent carriers of a disease. Therefore, extreme vigilance is required in the fight against this infection type.\nCommon Viral Diseases\nAmong the common examples of viral diseases in crop plants:\n- Tobacco mosaic manifests in dwarfism and mosaic-like patterns on leaves. The disease is widespread throughout the world and can have significant economic consequences.\n- Tomato spotted wilt is accompanied by the appearance and growth of necrotic yellow rings that gradually turn reddish-brown.\n- Potato spindle tuber inhibits plant growth, tubers become fusiform and shrink.\n- Cucumber mosaic virus produces mosaic dots and discolorations, malformations and distortions on fruits, narrow younger leaves, round spots, and causes general stunted growth.\n- Barley yellow dwarf is a cereal crop disease that is also dangerous to growing wheat. The symptoms include pale green leaves, chlorosis, poor tillering and flowering, smaller grains, and reduced yields.\n- Prunus necrotic ring spot virus produces round dots on the leaves of plums, apricots, peaches, nectarines and other trees of the Prunus family. Early signs are yellowish and brownish leaves while at severe stages, the symptoms include foliage holes and premature dropping.\n- Citrus exocortis causes stunted development in infected plants and affects leaf midribs and crowns, leading to necrosis. Another sign is root bark peeling (aka rootstock molting).\nYes, they do. Soil microorganisms increase immunity, protect plants from many pathogens. Moreover, if beneficial microbes are present in the roots of a plant, it can fight pests more effectively while maintaining natural growth.\nControl Of Crop Diseases Caused By Viruses\nUnlike previous infections, most vegetable crop disease caused by viruses is extremely difficult to defeat, often impossible. Therefore, control, in this case, should be as effective as possible. Among the most common measures is the cultivation of resistant crops, indexing, determining the absence or virus presence that is not mechanically transmitted. The plant under study is grafted onto an indicator plant, which develops corresponding symptoms in the virus presence. Unfortunately, sometimes it is necessary to destroy infected cultures, and if large agricultural areas are affected, even to introduce quarantine to save the rest of the crop yield.\nCrop Diseases Caused By Parasitic Plants\nParasitic plants are among the most dangerous plant pests in the world. With the help of particular organs, these plants settle in a host plant and satisfy at the expense of it (most often its vascular system). Although many parasites only weaken their \u201cprey\u201d, some can kill a plant and pose a severe economic threat to agriculture. Depending on the species, parasites can attach from one to several dozen plant species.\nCommon Parasitic Plants\nToday, there are about 400 parasitic plant species that have a substantial impact on the ecosystem in which they exist. Let\u2019s look at a few common examples.\nMistletoe (Viscaceae)\nThis semi-parasitic plant is widely represented throughout the world and is evergreen. As a parasite, mistletoe can exist on a significant number of plant species. It spreads thanks to special seeds that stick to birds and are carried with them to other plants. These seeds germinate through the host plant bark and connect to its food system.\nCuscuta spp.\nCuscuta spp. is a parasitic bindweed plant, which is very dangerous for various plants. It actively spreads, disrupts the metabolism of host plants, reduces productivity, and often leads to the death of plants. Moreover, Cuscuta spp. can be a carrier of viral plant and animal diseases. Because of all these features, the weed is a quarantine object.\nOrobanche spp.\nIt is a dangerous root parasite without green leaves that cannot photosynthesize, and is utterly dependent on a host. For seed germination of Orobanche spp., it is required that a suitable plant is planted in the soil. Then the weed will attach to its roots and begin to receive ready-made food. The parasite leaves up to 100,000 seeds. They remain viable in the ground for over ten years while waiting for a host. All it makes Orobanche spp. a dangerous pest.\nStriga spp.\nThis group of parasitic plants is mainly found in tropical and subtropical regions and belongs to quarantine plants. In African countries, they are classified as a pandemic since Striga spp. can destroy up to 100 percent of a plant and cause irreparable economic damage. Primarily, this herb infects cereals but can also parasitize other plants, for example, when growing sugar cane. It\u2019s spread through seeds, growing together when ripe with the root system of a host plant. These parasites are very tenacious, so re-planting of a previously infected area is possible after nine years. In regions dependent on agriculture, the Striga spp. can even lead to the migration of people.\nWitchweed\nWitchweed is a renowned parasitic plant of the Striga family that grows in the countries of Africa and Asia. Witchweed damages the roots of corn, sorghum, sugarcane, and other agricultural types. In particular, witchweed threatens growing rice. Depriving host plants of water and nutrients, this parasitic plant significantly reduces yields. The deprived plants suffer from chlorosis and stunted growth, and often die prematurely. A single witchweed plant can produce hundreds of thousands of seeds that can survive in the soil for years. Wtichweeds are quite hard to control and are typically tackled with crop rotation, trap plants, and treatment with herbicides.\nMethods Of Controlling Crop Diseases Caused By Parasitic Plants\nThere are different ways of pest control. One of them is \u201csuicidal germination,\u201d cultivating the soil to create favorable conditions for a parasite. In the absence of a host, the germinated seeds will die.\nAlso, farmers actively apply herbicides to resistant crops, which prevents parasites from attaching to them. However, these preparations are pretty expensive. Therefore, it is often necessary to use manual weeding and rotation of crops that are not hosts. However, the most helpful remedy remains the use of naturally sustainable plants.\nCrop Protection And Disease Control With Satellite-Derived Data\nThe first step towards crop disease management is understanding the essence of an illness and the process of its development. Also, remember that any crop can get sick, and abiotic factors, such as unfavorable weather conditions, weaken the plants and increase the risk of infection. Causal agents are activated in the presence of many factors; therefore, the prevention measures of crop plant diseases should be well-thought-out and comprehensive. The use of satellite data allows farmers to arm themselves with all the necessary information for these purposes. They can remotely monitor the state of fields, predict future changes, and plan agricultural processes, including preventive measures to prevent crop disease.\nDisease Risk Detection And Assessment\nBecause it is by far easier to mitigate yield losses by taking prompt actions before crops are affected, it is important to detect any risks early. Now, the Disease Risk feature on EOSDA Crop Monitoring enables farmers to eradicate losses by reporting critical situations. Furthermore, our feature doesn\u2019t only allow for early crop disease risk detection but also for risk assessment, reporting the zones with various risk severity. This way, agriculturalists can prioritize their efforts and, respectively, tackle the problem first where the risk is high.\nThus, ongoing disease risk monitoring helps save the plants before the disease spreads on the field and makes irreparable damage to crops. Another pleasant benefit of the new feature is that knowing the risks early also reduces expenses and saves resources on managing crop disease when it has already developed in the field, contributing to sustainable agriculture.\nCrop Susceptibility Monitoring\nSince each crop is more resistant to some diseases and less resistant to others, rotation effectively avoids spreading the same causal agents. When the same crop is grown annually on one field, often used in industrial/intensive agriculture systems, EOSDA Crop Monitoring allows you to monitor the productivity of this area and understand the yield trend (increase or decrease) using regularly updated satellite imagery. Also, the Data manager in EOSDA Crop Monitoring enables you to analyze data from harvesters. Manual comparison of this info with the data of productivity maps allows you to make a more accurate analysis of your yield and the factors that influenced it in certain places of a field. Productivity maps divide fields into corresponding zones over a given period, reflecting how well or poorly the plants are developed in certain areas during that period. Managing crop diseases pay attention to enlarging areas of low productivity. Biotic pathogens may cause them.\nIn crop rotation practices, productivity maps provide information on the productivity of all crops in the system. EOSDA Crop Monitoring can help you analyze remotely how specific rotations are effective against particular diseases. It allows you to experiment with cultures for crop rotation, monitor their productivity, and choose the best crop rotation option for a field, including for disease-preventive purposes.\nMonoculture farming contributes to the accumulation of pathogens in the soil. The rotation of different plants using crop rotation reduces their population because by losing the host, the pests die.\nAbiotic Stress Level Indicators\nAs mentioned above, abiotic factors can severely weaken plants and thus reduce their natural ability to resist disease. Thanks to using satellite data, EOSDA Crop Monitoring has several functions that help to identify abiotic stress of various origins timely:\n- monitoring soil moisture levels;\n- automatic alarm for heat and cold stress;\n- extensive weather analytics, including air temperature, precipitation, wind speed, humidity;\n- NDMI maps for monitoring plant water content.\nEach indicator can signal crop stress. The EOSDA Crop Monitoring package of vegetation indices helps to analyze the impact of the above and other abiotic factors on the health of crops.\nPathogen Attack Detection\nEOSDA Crop Monitoring uses vegetation indices (NDVI, NDMI, ReCl, NDRE) to help identify infected areas remotely. Also, the system has a scouting function to check for the presence of a pathogen or a disease itself. With its help, farmers can set scouting tasks based on satellite data on the state of a field. The EOSDA Crop Monitoring interface is very convenient for the scouts themselves. When confirming the detection of crop damage, the scouts can immediately select the one of types of crop disease (biotic or abiotic) and describe it to agronomists and farmers.\nIf necessary, scouts can attach a photo. And farmers get all this information without a direct presence in a field or personal communication with the scout. This approach to identifying and verifying the problem saves resources: daily remote checkups from EOSDA Crop Monitoring reduce the amount of fuel for agricultural equipment, the working hours of scouts and farmers, and allow quickly responding to any deviations from the norm of crop development.\nAnother feature included in the zoning functionality on EOSDA Crop Monitoring is vegetation maps. When the scouts have confirmed the problem, based on such maps, farmers can monitor how diseases develop in their fields, generate a vegetation map and differentiate herbicides, fungicides, or other chemicals that help fight diseases, and watch the effectiveness of ongoing operations. Thus, farmers save money on the substances themselves and prevent them from contaminating areas not requiring intervention.\nThus, crop plant diseases are inevitable, so sooner or later, any farmer will face them. However, even if we cannot eliminate the likelihood of crop disease, we can minimize it with effective crop disease control and integrated weed management. Modern technologies such as satellite data help monitor the condition of fields remotely and identify potentially dangerous areas timely. However, applications like EOSDA Crop Monitoring are practical for more than just identification and management. They have a whole host of valuable features that farmers can use around the entire growing season and in-between.\nAbout the author:\nVasyl Cherlinka is a Doctor of Biosciences specializing in pedology (soil science), with 30 years of experience in the field.

        "html": "While plant diseases are inevitable in a garden, it\u2019s often much easier to prevent the disease than to treat them. A healthy growing environment is vital in avoiding issues like pests and diseases. How well you know your garden will affect how you tackle any health issues. In this guide, we\u2019re outlining some of the most common plant diseases and how to control them:\nContents [ ]\nIdentifying and Treating Plant Diseases\nGeneral Tips for Preventing Plant Diseases\nIdentifying and Treating Plant Diseases\nIf not caused by pests, plants are susceptible to fungal, bacterial, and viral diseases. However, about 85% of plant health problems are caused by fungal infections.\nFungal Plant Diseases\nFungi is the most common cause of all plant diseases. That\u2019s because the majority of pathogens are found in the fungal category. Fungi also spread quickly through natural openings, so any trauma caused to the plant might lead to fungal disease. Pruning, harvesting, and nibbles from pests and insects, for example, cause natural openings that could get infected by pathogens. Types of fungal plant diseases include:\nPowdery mildew: caused by soil-borne fungi. This disease often affects fruit-bearing plants like apples, grapes, gooseberries, strawberries, peaches, and plums. Some flowering plants are susceptible to powdery mildew, such as lilacs, daisies, and roses. A powdery coating on the leaves is the telltale sign of powdery mildew.\nRust: Leaf rust is caused by the fungus Puccinia triticina, a type of obligate parasite that grows on a living host. The telltale signs of leaf rust are discolored leaves and yellow-orange spots that spread all over the leaves until wilted. Blister-like swellings under the leaves, called pustules, are also signs of rust infection in plants. While rust affects many plants, roses and herbaceous plants are the most vulnerable to rust.\nRoot Rot: Root rot is caused by causal organisms like Pythium, Phytophthora, Rhizoctonia, and Fusarium that attack the root systems of plants. This disease is caused by excess moisture and a dank, damp growing environment. Pathogens thrive in soggy conditions, which weaken the roots, preventing proper oxygen absorption. If the roots are not absorbing oxygen well, they die. The pathogens that cause root rot tend to stay dormant in the soil for a long time until the ground becomes waterlogged. When this happens, the spores spring to life, attaching soft, tender roots until they become dark and decayed. Crops like beetroots, carrots, parsnips, potatoes, celery, and asparagus are some of the many that are vulnerable to root rot.\nDamping Off: Damping off is a disease caused by several fungi and fungus-like organisms. This disease commonly affects seedlings. The telltale sign of damping off is a mass of white fungal growth all over the plant leaves. When infected, seedlings collapse, wilt, and die. Damping off is common in greenhouses, but it\u2019s also spread in outdoor gardens due to soggy conditions.\nPreventing Fungal Disease in Plants\nFungal diseases are often caused by exposure to excessive moisture for prolonged periods. Standing water, waterlogged soil, poor drainage, a wet, humid environment, overwatering, poor air circulation, the lack of protection from winds or rain, etc., are just some of the many causes of fungal diseases in plants.\nChecking the plants for fungal growth is vital to containing an infestation. If the disease has spread to some plants, separate the affected plants from the rest. Then, remove the infected foliage and destroy them. Avoid overhead watering and water only during mid-mornings to allow the plants to dry off throughout the day. Finally, improve the air circulation and water drainage in the garden to prevent fungal diseases.\nBacterial Plant Diseases\nBacterial plant diseases are the opposite of fungal diseases; they\u2019re quite rare. That\u2019s because the bacteria that cause plant diseases are not as aggressive as fungal pathogens. Bacteria may infect the plants through natural openings, like a cut from pruning. Pathogens can be spread by birds and insects too. Although uncommon, bacterial diseases are often fatal in plants. Types of bacterial plant diseases include:\nCanker: This bacterial plant disease is caused by two types of bacteria, Pseudomonas syringae PV. syringae (Pss) and P. syringae PV., and are common in wounded or stressed trees and bushes. The infected area starts as an injury and slowly turns into dead tissues that grow gradually \u2013 usually for several years. Sunken, swollen, flattered, or dead areas of a plant stem, limb, or trunk are telltale signs of cankers.\nLeaf Spot: Leaf spot is a common viral infection that causes lesions, discoloration, and dark spots on plant leaves. The lesions often have a center of necrosis (cell death), a sign that the plant is not absorbing oxygen properly. This plant disease is caused by Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas\u200b, and Acidovorax bacteria. Green, leafy vegetables like brassicas and cabbages are prone to leaf spots.\nSoft Rot: This disease is caused by a bacteria that secrete an enzyme capable of destroying cell wall structures, causing the plant tissues to become soggy and watery. Fleshy crops, such as potato, carrot, eggplant, squash, etc., are prone to soft rot. Brassicas, lettuces, onions, courgettes, tomatoes, and parsnips are also vulnerable to this plant disease.\nPreventing Bacterial Diseases in Plants\nPlant bacteria thrive in wet environments with poor drainage. In some cases, the spread of bacterial diseases is caused by rodents and insects. To contain an infestation, remove the affected plants, prune the diseased leaves, and destroy them. Avoid overcrowding and overwatering of plants. Maintain a healthy growing environment by protecting the plants from rodents and insects that could carry bacterial diseases. Using organic fertilizers also makes plants resistant to bacterial infection.\nViral Plant Diseases\nPlant viruses behave similarly to viruses that infect humans \u2013 they need a living host to survive. Plants have cell walls that protect them from viruses, but natural openings can lead to an infection. Without intervention, viral plant diseases can turn deadly. What makes viral plant diseases different from other plant diseases is that detection is more challenging. That\u2019s because most of the physical manifestations of the disease can be mistaken for natural physiological defects in plants. Types of viral plant diseases include:\nMosaic virus: One of the telltale signs of the mosaic virus in plants is mottled, yellowed spots or streaks all over the leaves. The mosaic virus often affects fruit-bearing crops like tomatoes, potatoes, squash, aubergines, courgettes, cucumbers, marrow, pumpkins, and cucumbers. The virus is a prolific spreader, infecting more than 150 different varieties of plants. Aphids often spread this disease, so keeping an eye out for this critter will minimize the risk of infection.\nCurly top virus: The curly top is caused by the curto viruses (genus Curtovirus). As the name implies, the curly top virus causes the diseased plants\u2019 leaves to bunch up or curl up. The infected plants become smaller as the virus spreads, eventually causing the petals and leaves to twist and pull out of shape. The affected leaves become yellowed and thickened, eventually dying. Tomatoes, beans, spinach, and peppers are just some of the many crops affected by the curly top virus.\nSpotted wilt: This viral disease is spread by several species of thrips, a common garden pest. The insect infects plants by feeding and transmitting the virus by sucking mouthparts. Some telltale signs of spotted wilt include brownish, purplish, reddish, or greenish rings and spots on the leaves, flowers, and fruits.\nPreventing Viral Diseases in Plants\nViral diseases in plants are much harder to treat because it takes immunization to minimize the effects of the pathogens on the plants. Like humans, the plants\u2019 immune system has to fight off the infection. Treatments can only alleviate the symptoms, not cure the disease.\nYou must prevent viruses from entering and spreading to the garden in the first place to avoid viral diseases in plants. Improving air circulation and preventing gardening during wet weather conditions help reduce the chances of a viral attack. Spacing out each plant is key to better ventilation. If you see signs of an infection, remove the affected plants immediately to contain the disease\u2019s spread.\nGeneral Tips for Preventing Plant Diseases\nKeep the garden clean\nSticking to standard sanitation practices is one of the most effective ways of preventing plant diseases. This includes removing unwanted debris, pruning dying or unhealthy foliage with a hand pruner or a pair of gardening shears, and pulling weeds. Discard diseased foliage in the trash and do not add these to a compost pile. Pathogens must be killed by extreme heat, and compost piles do not generate enough heat to kill infectious microbes. Quite the opposite, fungi, bacteria, and viruses could thrive in a compost pile.\nAvoid over-fertilizing\nOver-fertilizing can weaken the plants\u2019 growths, which could make the plants vulnerable to pests and diseases. Add fertilizers only when needed to build the plants\u2019 immunity against diseases.\nCheck for diseases\nThis goes for new and existing plants in your garden. If you\u2019re introducing new plants to the garden, be sure to check the leaves and stems for potential pests or diseases. For existing plants, make a habit of closely inspecting the plants before watering them. If you see signs of a fungal infection, yellowing, or wilting foliage, remove the affected plants from the garden.\nWatch the soil temperature\nIt\u2019s never a good idea to water your plants when the weather is cool or damp. Water only when needed, and check the soil temperature before proceeding. Plants are less likely to fight off diseases when exposed to standing water and cold temperatures. Time your watering well and ensure that excess water drains away from the plants.\nAvoid overhead watering\nThis is a critical step in preventing any kind of disease or pest in the garden: never wet the foliage! Plant leaves cannot absorb moisture at all. Most fungal infections thrive in damp, cold environments. Don\u2019t leave your plants vulnerable to pathogens; water plants early in the day (before 9 AM), and avoid overhead watering. Use soaker hoses, drip irrigation, etc., to hydrate the plants.\nPromote good air circulation\nPathogens hate growing environments with excellent air circulation. Give each plant ample space to grow, and avoid overcrowding. Regular pruning also helps improve airflow.\nProtecting the garden from diseases is a tough job, but through constant vigilance, it\u2019s possible to keep pathogens away for a long time. Having the right gardening tools also helps reduce the chances of viruses, bacteria, and fungi making a home out of your garden."

        "html": "Spanish Version\nClick here for a Chinese translation of this article (pdf file, 1.6 MB)\nThe goal of plant disease management is to reduce the economic and aesthetic damage caused by plant diseases. Traditionally, this has been called plant disease control, but current social and environmental values deem \u201ccontrol\u201d as being absolute and the term too rigid. More multifaceted approaches to disease management, and integrated disease management, have resulted from this shift in attitude, however. Single, often severe, measures, such as pesticide applications, soil fumigation or burning are no longer in common use. Further, disease management procedures are frequently determined by disease forecasting or disease modeling rather than on either a calendar or prescription basis. Disease management might be viewed as proactive whereas disease control is reactive, although it is often difficult to distinquish between the two concepts, especially in the application of specific measures.\nThis topic is a general overview of some of the many methods, measures, strategies and tactics used in the control or management of plant diseases. Specific management programs for specific diseases are not intended since these will often vary depending on circumstances of the crop, its location, disease severity, regulations and other factors. Most states have some agency such as the Agricultural Extension Service or State Department of Agriculture that formulates and promulgates disease management recommendations for that state. Involvement of these agencies is especially important where the practices include some regulated component such as pesticides or quarantines. Management procedures for some specific crops and diseases can be found in the\nAPSnet Education Center online plant disease lessons.\nPlant disease management practices rely on anticipating occurrence of disease and attacking vulnerable points in the disease cycle (i.e., weak links in the infection chain). Therefore, correct diagnosis of a disease is necessary to identify the pathogen, which is the real target of any disease management program. (See\nIntroductory topic: Plant Disease Diagnosis) A thorough understanding of the disease cycle, including climatic and other environmental factors that influence the cycle, and cultural requirements of the host plant, are essential to effective management of any disease.\nThe many strategies, tactics and techniques used in disease management can be grouped under one or more very broad principles of action. Differences between these principles often are not clear. The simplest system consists of two principles, prevention (prophylaxis in some early writings) and therapy (treatment or cure).\nThe first principle (prevention) includes disease management tactics applied\nbefore infection (i.e., the plant is protected from disease), the second principle (therapy or curative action) functions with any measure applied\nafter the plant is infected (i.e., the plant is treated for the disease). An example of the first principle is enforcement of quarantines to prevent introduction of a disease agent (pathogen) into a region where it does not occur.\nThe second principle is illustrated by heat or chemical treatment of vegetative material such as bulbs, corms, and woody cuttings to eliminate fungi, bacteria, nematodes or viruses that are established within the plant material. Chemotherapy is the application of chemicals to an infected or diseased plant that stops (i.e., eradicates) the infection. Although many attempts have been made to utilize chemotherapy, few have been successful. In a few diseases of ornamental or other high value trees, chemotherapy has served as a holding action that must be repeated at intervals of one to several years. For example, antibiotics have been infused into plants to reduce severity of phytoplasma diseases of palms (lethal yellowing) and pears (pear decline) and fungicides have been injected into elms to reduce severity of Dutch elm disease (caused by\nOphiostoma ulmi) (Figure 1) but in all cases the chemotherapeutant must be reapplied periodically. There also are some \u201csystemic\u201d fungicides such as the sterol biosynthesis inhibiting (SBI) and demethylation inhibiting (DMI) fungicides that diffuse into the plant tissues to some extent and eliminate recently established infections.\nOne early proposal by H. H. Whetzel included four general disease control principles,\nexclusion,\neradication,\nprotection and\nimmunization (the latter principle is more appropriately called\nresistance since plants do not have an immune system in the same sense as animals). These principles have been expanded or altered to some extent by others. They are still valid and are detailed here but students should investigate other systems such as those proposed by G\u00e4umann, Sharvelle, or the National Academy of Science and use the one(s) that they believe are applicable. These and other disease control principles are discussed in Maloy, Plant Disease Control (1993) cited in the general references of this lesson.\nEXCLUSION\nThis principle is defined as any measure that prevents the introduction of a disease-causing agent (pathogen) into a region, farm, or planting. The basic strategy assumes that most pathogens can travel only short distances without the aid of some other agent such as humans or other vector, and that natural barriers like oceans, deserts, and mountains create obstacles to their natural spread. In many cases pathogens are moved with their host plants or even on nonhost material such as soil, packing material or shipping containers. Unfortunately, exclusion measures usually only delay the entry of a pathogen, although exclusion may provide time to plan how to manage the pathogen when it ultimately arrives. Karnal bunt (caused by\nTilletia indica) of wheat is an example of a pathogen originally from India that was anticipated. Measures were established to prevent its introduction, but it finally found its way into the United States. Soybean rust (caused by\nPhakopsora\npachyrhizi) has been found recently in the southeastern U.S. and precautions have been undertaken to prevent further spread. Due to its destructiveness, South American leaf blight (SALB) (caused by\nMicrocyclus ulei) is a feared disease in the major rubber producing region of Indonesia, and contingency plans have been proposed to chemically defoliate rubber trees by aerial application of herbicides if the pathogen is detected. It is hoped that this would prevent establishment of the pathogen in the region.\nIn the United States, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), a division of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is responsible for promulgating and enforcing plant quarantine measures. There are also state agencies that deal with local quarantines. Internationally, eight regional plant protection organizations (PPOs) were established in 1951 by the International Plant Protection Convention sponsored by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. This was revised in 1997 and now includes nine regional PPOs. The European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) is the oldest of the regional PPOs. The regional PPOs have no regulatory authority such as APHIS or other governmental agency, but function to develop strategies against the introduction and spread of pests and to coordinate the use of phytosanitary regulations to ensure agreement among the different member countries. For more information on the role of regional PPOs see\nwww.eppo.org/WORLDWIDE/worldwide.htm.\nAn important and practical strategy for excluding pathogens is to produce pathogen-free seed or planting stock through certification programs for seeds and vegetatively propagated plant materials such as potatoes, grapes, tree fruits, etc. These programs utilize technologies that include isolation of production areas, field inspections, and removal of suspect plants to produce and maintain pathogen-free stocks. Planting stock that is freed of pathogens can be increased by tissue culture and micropropagation techniques as well as be maintained in protective enclosures such as screenhouses to exclude pathogens and their vectors. Exclusion may be accomplished by something as simple as cleaning farming equipment (Figure 2) to remove contaminated debris and soil that can harbor pathogens such as\nVerticillium, nematodes or other soilborne organisms and prevent their introduction into non-infested fields.\nERADICATION\nThis principle aims at eliminating a pathogen after it is introduced into an area but before it has become well established or widely spread. It can be applied to individual plants, seed lots, fields or regions but generally is not effective over large geographic areas. Two large attempts at pathogen eradication in the United States were the golden nematode (Globodera rostochiensis) program on Long Island, New York and the citrus canker (caused by\nXanthomonas axonopodis pv.\ncitri and pv.\naurantifolii) program in Florida. However, neither of these attempts was a lasting success.\nEradication of the golden nematode involved removing infested soil, fumigating soil in infested fields and eventually abandoning infested potato fields for housing developments and other uses. Citrus canker eradication involved widespread removal and burning of diseased trees and, in some cases, destruction of entire citrus groves and nurseries (Figure 3). The disease appeared to be contained and the pathogen eradicated, but the disease has reappeared and new attempts at eradication are ongoing. (See\nCitrus canker disease lesson)\nEradication can also be on a more modest scale such as the removal of apple or pear branches infected by the fire blight bacterium (Erwinia amylovora) or pruning to remove blister rust cankers (caused by\nCronartium ribicola) on white pine branches. Or, it can be the sorting and removal of diseased flower bulbs, corms or rhizomes. Hot water seed-treatment of cereal seeds to kill smut mycelium in the seed and heat treatment to eliminate viruses from fruit tree budwood for grafting are other examples of pathogen eradication.\nTwo programs that are actually forms of protection and not pathogen eradication are barberry eradication for reducing stem rust (caused by\nPuccinia graminis) of wheat and\nRibes eradication for preventing white pine blister rust. The strategy is that removing these alternate hosts breaks the disease cycles and prevents infection of the economically more valuable host. These two examples are mentioned here because they are frequently cited as eradication measures. However, stem rust can readily spread from wheat to wheat in many regions by the uredinial stage although elimination of the aecial host, barberry, may deter or diminish the development of pathogenic races of the rust. The white pine blister rust fungus is perennial in the pine host and eradication of the alternate host only protects noninfected trees but does not necessarily eliminate the pathogen from the area.\nEradication may also be accomplished by destroying weeds that are reservoirs of various pathogens or their insect vectors (Figure 4). Elimination of potato cull piles (Figure 5) is an effective method of eradicating overwintering inoculum of the late blight pathogen.\nSoil fumigation has been a widely used eradication strategy. This technology involves introducing gas-forming chemicals such as carbon disulfide, methyl bromide, or chloropicrin into soil to kill target pathogens. However, undesirable side effects such as killing beneficial organisms, contamination of groundwater, and toxicity of these chemicals have resulted in less reliance on this approach for disease management. Volatile fumigants like methyl bromide are injected into soil and sealed with a plastic film (Figure 6). Some water-soluble fumigants like metam-sodium can be injected into the soil and the soil simply compacted to form a seal (Figure 7).\nCrop rotation is a frequently used strategy to reduce the quantity of a pathogen, usually soil-borne organisms, in a cropping area. Take-all of wheat (caused by\nGaeumannomyces graminis) and soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines) (Figure 8) are two examples of soilborne diseases that are easily managed by short rotations of 1 and 2 years, respectively, out of susceptible crops, which may include susceptible weed hosts such as grasses in the case of take-all. (See\nTake-all disease lesson and\nSoybean cyst nematode disease lesson)\nBurning is an effective means of eradicating pathogens and is often required by law to dispose of diseased elm trees affected by Dutch elm disease (DED) (Figure 9) (See\nDutch elm disease lesson), citrus trees infected by citrus canker (Figure 3) (See\nCitrus canker disease lesson) or of bean fields infected by halo blight bacteria (Pseudomonas syringae pv.\nphaseolicola). Propane flaming can effectively destroy\nVerticillium microsclerotia in mint stems (Figure 10) (See\nVerticillium wilt disease lesson) , and flaming potato stems prior to harvest may prevent tuber infection by the late blight pathogen (Figure 11) (See\nLate blight disease lesson). However, burning agricultural fields is controversial because the smoke creates human health and safety and environmental concerns.\nStudents may note that the principle of eradication is a good example of the conflicting concepts of some of these general principles for at least two reasons. One is that some of the examples above could be placed as readily under protection as under eradication. The second is that complete eradication of pathogens, especially from large areas is rarely accomplished.\nPROTECTION\nThis principle depends on establishing a barrier between the pathogen and the host plant or the susceptible part of the host plant. It is usually thought of as a chemical barrier, e.g., a fungicide, bactericide or nematicide, but it can also be a physical, spatial, or temporal barrier. The specific strategies employed assume that pathogens are present and that infection will occur without the intervention of protective measures. For example, bananas are covered with plastic sleeves as soon as the fruit are set (Figure 12) to protect the fruit from various pests including fruit decay fungi.\nProtection often involves some cultural practice that modifies the environment, such as tillage, drainage, irrigation, or altering soil pH. It may also involve changing date or depth of seeding, plant spacing, pruning and thinning, or other practices that allow plants to escape infection or reduce severity of disease. Raising planting beds (Figure 13) to assure good soil water drainage is an example of cultural management of plant diseases such as root and stem rots.\nFungicides have been used for more than a hundred years and new fungicides continue to be developed. (See\nIntroductory topic: What are fungicides?) Bordeaux mixture, a basic copper sulfate fungicide, was the first widely used fungicide and is still used today in various forms. The earliest fungicides were simple elements like sulfur or metallic compounds of copper or mercury, and these are generally classed as inorganic fungicides. In the early to mid-1900s organic fungicides such as thiram, captan, and the bisdithiocarbamates were developed. These are broad-spectrum, contact or protectant fungicides that control a wide range of fungal diseases. Starting in the 1960s the \u201csystemic\u201d fungicides were developed. Most of these are not truly systemic in plants but have some limited mobility, usually translaminar, and often give some post-infection benefits. Some of the \u201csystemic\u201d fungicides move upward in the plant\u2019s vascular system, but currently only one (fosetyl-Al) has ambimobile distribution (both upward and downward) that would constitute a truly systemic fungicide. In addition to the SBI and DMI fungicides mentioned earlier, a recent group of systemic fungicides are the strobilurins. (See\nAdvanced topic: QoI (strobilurin) fungicides: Benefits and risks) Some fungicides have narrow ranges of activity and are used primarily for control of specific groups of diseases such as downy mildews, rusts, smuts or powdery mildews while others are active against a wider range of diseases.\nOne liability of these recent narrow-range fungicides is that they often have single-site modes of action, (that is, their site-specific activity is controlled by one or a few genes), and thus are especially prone to development of fungicide resistance in the pathogen. Several management strategies have been developed to combat fungicide resistance. These include using mixtures of single-site and multi-site fungicides, alternating applications of fungicides with different modes of action, applying fungicides only when needed instead of on either a calendar or prescription basis, and applying the recommended dosage and not attempting to cut costs by reducing the recommended amount of fungicide applied.\nFungicides can be applied by any of several methods: ground sprayers (Figure 14), airplanes (Figure 15) or through irrigation systems, but to be effective applications must be done properly. First, the fungicide must be legally registered for use on the plant involved and against the target disease. Several different chemicals may be registered for the same crop or disease. If the different fungicides are similar in effectiveness, cost, ease of application, and safety, then timing of application becomes the most critical factor. If applied too early much of the chemical will be wasted before it can be effective; if applied too late, it will be largely ineffective. The benefits of properly applied fungicides can often be striking (Figure 16). Distribution of the spray droplets is important; the finer the spray the more complete the coverage on the plant surface (Figure 17). However, very small droplets form a mist that is easily displaced by wind.\nMany cultural practices can be modified to manage the occurrence, intensity or severity of plant diseases. These include selection of suitable growing sites for the crop, adequate tillage to bury pathogen-infested plant residues, rotation to nonsusceptible crops, selecting pathogen-free planting stocks, orientation of plantings to improve exposure to sun and air currents, pruning and thinning to eliminate sources of infection and improve aeration in and around susceptible plants, water management on both plants and in soil, adequate nutrition, proper cultivation to improve root growth and avoid plant injury, and sanitation procedures to eliminate sources of inoculum.\nBiological control involves the use of one living organism to control another, and this management technology has received much attention in recent times. However, the number of biological agents registered for use is relatively small, success has been limited, and application has been largely restricted to intensively managed, high value crops such as greenhouse plants. Two examples of effective biological control are the use of the fungus\nPeniophora gigantea to inoculate tree stumps to prevent infection of adjacent trees by the wood decay fungus\nHeterobasidion annosum, and the application of the nonpathogenic (i.e., non-tumor-producing) bacterium\nAgrobacterium radiobacter to fruit trees before planting to prevent infection by the crown gall bacterium (Agrobacterium tumefaciens) (see\nCrown gall disease lesson)\nRESISTANCE\nUse of disease-resistant plants is the ideal method to manage plant diseases, if plants of satisfactory quality and adapted to the growing region with adequate levels of durable resistance are available. The use of disease-resistant plants eliminates the need for additional efforts to reduce disease losses unless other diseases are additionally present. Resistant plants are usually derived by standard breeding procedures of selection and/or hybridization. A few disease-resistant lines have been obtained by inducing mutations with x-rays or chemicals. There is also interest in chemicals called \u201cplant activators\u201d that induce plant defense responses called systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and induced resistance. Recently, resistant plants have been developed through the use of genetic engineering (e.g., resistance to the\nPapaya ringspot virus). (See\nAPSnet Feature: Transgenic Virus Resistant Papaya.)\nSelection of resistant plants involves subjecting plants to high levels of disease pressure (Figure 18) and using the surviving plants as sources of disease resistance. Plants that survive this pressure often have genetic resistance that can be utilized directly by propagation or as sources of resistance to develop resistant plants that also have the requisite qualities for that crop. Hybridization is a tactic where a plant having the desired agronomic or horticultural qualities, but is susceptible to a disease, is crossed with a plant that is resistant but which may or may not have the other desirable characteristics such as size, yield, flavor, aesthetics, etc.\nDisease escape occurs when susceptible plants do not become diseased for some reason. This may be due to some anatomical or physical character, such as the occurrence of leaf hairs, thick cuticle, or modified stomata, or they may be environmental, in which conditions are not conducive to disease development. Although disease escape based on some anatomical feature is useful occasionally, escape more often complicates the process of developing disease resistant plants.\nDevelopment of disease-resistant plants has been relatively successful with annual and biennial plants, but less so with perennials, primarily because of the longer time required to develop and test the progeny. Woody perennials, such as ornamental, forest, and orchard trees, have been especially difficult for plant breeders to develop useful disease resistance. For example, chestnut blight and Dutch elm disease have devastated two valued native trees. In both cases there have been extensive attempts to develop resistant trees, usually by creating hybrids with exotic chestnut or elm trees, and some resistant selections have resulted. Unfortunately, these generally lack the desirable qualities, such as nut flavor or tree forms characteristic of the native trees. Another introduced disease that has impacted native trees is white pine blister rust. There has been an intense effort for more than 50 years to select and improve rust-resistant pines from the surviving population. These trees are now being planted for reforestation, but it will be another 50 or so years, when these trees have matured to produce a timber crop, before the success of this program is known.\nDevelopment of resistance has been most successful against the more specialized pathogens such as rust fungi (Figure 19), smut fungi, powdery mildew fungi, and viruses, but less so against general pathogens such as many blight, canker, root rot and leaf spotting pathogens.\nA major problem with genetically resistant plants is that host-differentiated pathogenic races can be selected, so that many breeding programs become continuous processes to develop disease resistant plant lines. Disease resistance conferred by a single major gene is sometimes called specific or qualitative resistance and is race-specific. This type of resistance is often unstable, and emergence of a pathogenic race that can attack that genotype can completely overcome this type of resistance. Quantitative resistance or general resistance derives from many different genes for resistance with additive effects to provide more stable (or durable) resistance to pathogens.\nThere are several strategies to minimize this race development and resistance failure. These include methods of gene deployment, where different genetic plant types are interspersed on a regional basis to avoid a genetic monoculture, or planting mixtures of cultivars having different genetic compositions to ensure that some component of the crop will be resistant to the disease. (See\nAdvanced topic: Cultivar Mixtures)\nA recent and controversial technique in developing disease resistant plants is the insertion of genes from other organisms into plants to impart some characteristic. For example, genes from the bacterium\nBacillus thuringiensis have been inserted into plants to protect against insect attacks. Plants with these inserted genes are called genetically-modified organisms (GMOs), and have caused concern that unanticipated, and perhaps detrimental, characteristics, such as unforeseen allergens, may also be transferred to the new plants. However, unforeseen and undesirable qualities also can be transmitted by conventional plant breeding techniques. The potato cultivar Lenape was developed in part because of its resistance to\nPotato virus A and resistance to late blight tuber infection. After it was released it was discovered that the tubers contained very high levels of solanine, a toxic alkaloid. The wheat cultivar Paha had resistance to stripe rust (caused by\nPuccinia striiformis) but also was very susceptible to flag smut (caused by\nUrocystis agropyri). Both of these plant cultivars, developed by conventional breeding methods, were quickly taken out of production. There is much interest in the genetic engineering of disease-resistant plants and some success has been obtained with several virus diseases, the best known of which is papaya ringspot (Figure 20). This approach to plant disease management will likely expand, especially for widely grown crops such as wheat, corn, soybeans, rice, and the like, as social, legal, and economic obstacles are overcome.\nINTEGRATED DISEASE MANAGEMENT\nIntegrated Disease Management (IDM) is a concept derived from the successful Integrated Pest Management (IPM) systems developed by entomologists for insect and mite control. In most cases IDM consists of scouting with timely application of a combination of strategies and tactics. These may include site selection and preparation, utilizing resistant cultivars, altering planting practices, modifying the environment by drainage, irrigation, pruning, thinning, shading, etc., and applying pesticides, if necessary. But in addition to these traditional measures, monitoring environmental factors (temperature, moisture, soil pH, nutrients, etc.), disease forecasting, and establishing economic thresholds are important to the management scheme. These measures should be applied in a coordinated integrated and harmonized manner to maximize the benefits of each component. For example, balancing fertilizer applications with irrigation practices helps promote healthy vigorous plants. However, this is not always easy to accomplish, and \u201cdisease management\u201d may be reduced to single measures exactly the same as the ones previously called \u201cdisease control.\u201d Whatever the measures used, they must be compatible with the cultural practices essential for the crop being managed.\nREFERENCES\nArneson, P.

        "html": "The Plant Doctor: Watering and Plant Disease\nWater, especially water droplets on leaves and stems, plays a major part in plant diseases. Unlike other important factors, such as temperature, you can sometimes control water and moisture. By understanding a few basic principles of how free water (water droplets and films of water on the surface of plant tissues) relates to plant disease and by watering appropriately, you can limit disease in your garden.\nMost plant diseases in the state are caused by fungi, but bacterial diseases also occur. Fungi and bacteria that can cause disease are called pathogens. They spread by seed-like structures called spores or by cells.\nThe fungal spores and bacterial cells are often not released until they have been wet for a certain period. Once released, they may be carried on the wind, in raindrops, or in irrigation water. Fungi and bacteria must have water to spread and infect plants.\nFungal spores are small and delicate (Figure 1). Like plant seeds, they require moisture to begin germination, and once they germinate, they die if they dry. Many fungi require a film of free moisture for at least 9 hours to germinate and penetrate the plant leaf. Some require slightly less time and others more.\nSplashing water droplets move pathogen \u201cseeds\u201d short distances. The splash carries the \u201cseeds\u201d from the soil to lower plant leaves, from the lower plant leaves to the upper plant leaves, and from one plant to another. The \u201cseeds\u201d may move longer distances by windblown water droplets.\nMoisture is the critical factor in disease development. The amount of disease depends on the number and length of wet periods.\nYou can control many plant diseases by controlling the number of the free moisture periods and how long those periods last. Reduce the number of periods by watering only when needed, and then watering deeply.\nReduce the amount of time leaves are wet. Remember that dew is water, too, so your watering schedule has to account for it. Do not extend the period of leaf wetness by watering as the dew is beginning to dry in the morning or before it forms in the evening (Figure 2). Extending the period of leaf wetness will let more pathogen \u201cseeds\u201d germinate.\nObserve how long the dew stays on the plant canopies and turf; then water when the dew would normally be on the plants. Dew is usually present from about midnight to 8:00 in the morning. If watering in the evening, make sure you stop watering early enough that the watered areas dry before dark. If watering in the morning, stop early enough that the watered areas dry at the same time as or before unwatered areas.\nA plant has leaves on the outside and on the inside of its canopy. The inside leaves are sheltered from direct sun and drying winds, so water will stay longer on them. Plants shade the soil, slowing the drying time and raising the humidity levels around the plants. This means diseases are more likely to become established inside the plant canopy than on the outside.\nReduce disease inside plant canopies with proper pruning and landscaping. Make best use of morning winds and sun to dry your landscape. You may hasten drying of particularly valuable areas of turf or plants by brushing a bamboo pole or pulling a garden hose over them to remove the dew drops.\nConsider using drip irrigation in your established plantings and soaker hoses in your more temporary ones. If watering by hand, try to water at the base of plants. Drip irrigation and watering at the soil level will help reduce the amount of free moisture on plant canopies. This won\u2019t be possible with your lawn, so water it at the proper time.\nHow Much to Water\nHave you ever noticed that as you dig a hole, the soil becomes moister the deeper you dig? Even when the upper soil layers are quite dry, the deeper layers are moist. So there is more moisture deeper in the soil.\nHow does water get into the plant? Through the roots. So, putting the two together, you want the plant roots to penetrate as deeply into the soil as possible\u2014to avoid the drying cycles of the upper soil layers.\nHow can you do this? Encourage the roots to grow deeply. Just as branches twist and turn to get more light, roots grow toward a supply of water.\nIf the area is constantly watered lightly, there will be enough soil moisture just below the surface for the plants. But the soil moisture will dry up quickly and leave plants dessicated in hot weather. Instead, water deeply so the moisture penetrates to about 4 inches. Then, don\u2019t water until it is needed. See Figure 3.\nYou can check the depth of the soil moisture using an unpainted wooden dowel like you use a toothpick to check if a cake has fully baked. Soil crumbs clinging to the dowel indicate moist soil.\nBy understanding the association of free moisture to disease development and by changing your watering practice to cut the duration of leaf wetness and number of irrigations, you can lessen disease in your landscape.\nThe information given here is for educational purposes only.

But despite your best intentions, diseases often step in\u2014floating on gentle winds or splashing water\u2014and spoil your precious harvest.\nAt every experience level, it pays to take time to learn about common diseases and ways to prevent and control them. The good news is that fungal or fungal-like pathogens cause about 85 percent of all plant diseases.1 With the help of good garden practices and a trusted, proven fungicide you can prevent and control common garden fungal diseases effectively.\nGood gardening habits and effective treatment help prevent, stop and control fungal disease\nFungal diseases strike plants when conditions such as moisture and temperature encourage their development and spread. Those conditions vary according to the disease, but these simple cultural practices can help you limit their effect:\n- Start by planting healthy stock. Whether you're planting seed straight into your garden or using nursery-grown transplants, start with disease-free, disease-resistant seeds or plants from reputable growers.\n- Choose planting sites based on plant needs. Trying to force sun-loving veggies into shady spots only leads to added stress on your edibles and yourself. Proper planting sites go a long way toward preventing disease and disappointment.\n- Avoid overhead watering. Many fungal diseases can't germinate and spread unless leaves and other plant parts stay wet for long periods. You can't control rain, but you can control irrigation. Drip irrigation and careful hand watering keep leaves dry.\n- Water early in the day. If leaves do get wet, it's important they dry as soon as possible. Early watering means that sun, wind, and daytime temperatures help your edibles dry faster than they would near evening.\n- Don't crowd plants. Poor air circulation around your edibles traps humidity and keeps leaves wet longer. Read seed packages or plant tags for proper spacing, and follow their advice at planting time.\n- Don't work a wet garden. Some fungal diseases spread from plant to plant on wet boots and clothing, moist pruners, and even damp hands. Wait until your garden is dry before you dive in, and keep tools clean and sterile with a quick wipe of household disinfectant.\n- Treat with a trusted, proven fungicide. Preventive and ongoing treatments with highly effective products such as Daconil\u00ae fungicides from GardenTech\u00aebrand help keep both your garden free of fungal diseases and harvests ready for your table.\nTreatment with effective fungicides control disease and keep garden-to-table harvests healthy\nProven, effective fungicides help prevent fungal disease from becoming active, stop and control existing disease, and protect healthy edibles against fungal infections. Daconil\u00ae fungicides protect against more than 65 diseases, giving your edibles the broad-spectrum protection they need. Just follow the label instructions for your fruits and veggies, and protect your favorite edibles as follows:\nAlliums\nOnions, leeks, garlic, and shallots fall in a plant group known as the Allium family\u2014a group of veggies many home cooks can't imagine life without. Diseases that target these four favorites include Botrytis leaf blight (blast), downy mildew, and purple blotch. With the edible bulbs of these plants hidden in soil, leaves show symptoms first.\nStart treatment with Daconil\u00ae fungicide at the first sign of disease, and re-treat at intervals of at least seven days. For green onions, leeks, and shallots, allow at least 14 days between your final treatment and harvest. For dry bulb onions and garlic, allow seven days between harvest and treatment.\nBeans\nDepending on where you grew up, you may call these garden staples snap beans, string beans, or green beans. Whether planted in garden rows or grown in containers, they're delicious by any name. Rust and Botrytis blight, sometimes called gray mold, often threaten bean crops.\nBegin preventive applications with Daconil\u00ae fungicide during the early, pre-bean, bloom stage or treat as soon as signs of disease appear. Repeat at weekly intervals, always allowing at least seven days between treatments. Allow seven days between treatment and harvest as well.\nCarrots\nWith their edible roots growing underground, carrot tops take the hit from fungal diseases. With unhealthy leaves, carrots can't develop as well as they should. Carrots suffer from two main blight diseases: early or Cercospora blight, and late or Alternaria blight.\nTreat at the earliest signs of disease in your carrot patch and repeat as needed to maintain control. Allow at least seven days between applications, but Daconil\u00ae fungicide can treat carrots right up to harvest day.\nCelery\nSome gardeners grow celery in trenches where mounded soil protects the stalks, but others grow celery with both stalks and leaves exposed. Either way, fungal diseases such as early or Cercospora blight, late or Septoria blight, basal stalk rot, and pink rot affect these crops.\nStart preventive treatments with Daconil\u00ae fungicide as soon as celery transplants go into your garden. Re-treat regularly, always allowing seven days in between. As harvest approaches, be sure to allow at least seven days between your final application and harvest time.\nCole Crops\n\"Cole\" crops take their name from the Latin word meaning stalk or stem, which describes how these closely related members of the Brassica family grow. Diseases such as Alternaria leaf spot and downy mildew afflict cole crops such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and cauliflower.\nStart preventive treatment with Daconil\u00ae fungicides as soon as transplants go into the garden or as soon as weather conditions favor disease. Allow at least seven days between treatments, but you can treat these cole crops right up to harvest day.\nCorn (Sweet)\nThoughts of summer's first taste of garden-fresh corn-on-the-cob keep some gardeners going all winter. But fungal diseases such as Helminthosporium leaf blight and rust can make summery, fresh-corn meals a distant fantasy.\nTreat sweet corn grown for straight-to-the-table use as soon as conditions such as extended wetness and cool temperatures arise and favor disease. Repeat as needed, allowing minimum retreatment intervals of at least seven days. Allow 14 days between Daconil treatment and harvest. Do not apply to sweet corn grown for processing.\nCucurbits\nMembers of the Cucurbit family make the list of easy-to-grow favorites that gardeners turn to year after year. Cucumbers, melons, pumpkins, and summer and winter squash promise prolific harvests\u2014when protected from diseases such as anthracnose, Cercospora leaf spot, downy mildew, gummy stem blight (black rot), leaf blight, powdery mildew, scab, and target spot. Rhizoctonia fruit rot, also known as belly rot, hits cucumbers as well.\nStart preventive treatments as soon as these cucurbits reach their first true leaf stage or as soon as conditions are favorable for disease. Continue Daconil\u00ae fungicide treatments right up to harvest day, but always allow at least seven days between treatments.\nPotatoes\nThough you might not guess it from their appearance, potatoes are closely related to tomatoes and have some of the same fungal diseases, including early blight and late blight. Botrytis vine rot affects potatoes as well. Even though spuds develop below ground, diseases that harm their foliage affect the edible tubers as well.\nBegin treating potato plants as soon as they reach six inches tall or at the first sign of disease. Continue as needed to maintain disease control, allowing at least five days between retreatments. Daconil\u00ae fungicide treats potato plants right up to harvest digging day.\nStone Fruits\nApricots, cherries, nectarines, peaches, plums, and prunes are known for their sweet, succulent flesh\u2014and hard, stonelike pits. Fungal diseases such as brown rot blossom blight, Coryneum blight (shothole), peach leaf curl, scab, and cherry leaf spot attack their stone-fruit targets beginning early in spring.\nTreatment varies according to the fruit and the disease involved. Timing is crucial, so follow label instructions carefully. For example, early season treatment with Daconil\u00ae fungicide may occur at the popcorn stage\u2014when flower buds first show color\u2014and at full bloom, but never between fruit formation and harvest. Post-harvest treatment also depends on the fruit and the disease.\nTomatoes\nFrom beefy red slicers to heirloom paste-types, tomatoes are a must for nearly every fruit and veggie gardener, whether adding spots of color to edible landscapes or crowning a garden patch. Unfortunately, numerous diseases such as anthracnose, Alternaria fruit rot (black mold), Botrytis, gray mold, early blight, gray leaf spot, gray leaf mold, late blight, Rhizoctonia fruit rot, and Septoria leaf spot attack these earthy essentials.\nFortunately, Daconil\u00ae fungicide treats all these tomato diseases. Begin preventive treatments early in the season or as soon as conditions favor disease development. Then re-treat at intervals of at least seven days. With Daconil\u00ae fungicide, you can treat tomatoes right up to the day you pick and eat them off the vine.\nEven though fungal diseases are a fact of garden life, you can protect your favorite edibles and keep these crop stealers at bay. Put good garden practices to work and count on Daconil\u00ae fungicides, just as gardeners have done for more than 50 years. Then get ready for a healthy garden's bounty and good times at your table with friends and family.\nAlways read product labels thoroughly and follow instructions, including guidelines for treatable plants, application rates and frequencies, and pre-harvest intervals (PHI) for edible crops.\nDaconil is a registered trademark of GB Biosciences Corp.\nGardenTech is a registered trademark of Gulfstream Home and Garden, Inc.\nSource:\n1.

        "html": "Knowing how to identify and treat common tomato diseases is critical for growing successful crops. Most common diseases are caused by types of fungi that favor certain weather conditions such as excessive rain during cool or warm periods.\nGood garden practices go a long way to discourage infections, including:\n- Crop rotation to avoid diseases lurking in the soil\n- Debris removal\n- Growing plants on support structures so the foliage does not touch the ground\n- Weed and pest control\n- Growing the plant in full sun (six hours a day)\n- Proper spacing between plants for air circulation and to prevent soggy conditions\nEven the hardiest crop can succumb to any of the following 17 common diseases. Here are symptoms to watch for and ways to keep your tomatoes healthy.\nCommon Tomato Diseases | ||\n---|---|---|\nDisease | Primary Symptom | Treatment |\nEarly blight | Dark spots with rings on lower leaves | Pruning, fungicide |\nFusarium or verticillium wilt | Wilting during day, leaves turn yellow | Plant resistant varieties |\nPowdery mildew | Light green or yellow spots on leaves turn dusty white | Sulfur dust, fungicides, biofungicides, horticultural oil |\nAnthracnose | Small, sunken, water-soaked spots on ripening fruit | Fungicide |\nSeptoria leaf spot | Small, brown, round spots on leaves | Fungicide, biofungicide |\nBotrytis | Gray-brown mold on leaves, stems, or fruit | Fungicide, biofungicide specific for gray mold |\nBacterial speck | Irregular brown or black spots near leaf margins, on stems or fruit | Copper fungicide |\nSouthern blight | Stem lesions near the soil line | Solarization, fungicides, biofungicides, soil fumigants |\nGray leaf spot | Small dark spots with yellow halos | Select resistant varieties |\nLate blight | Greasy brown blotches with white mold | Copper spray |\nBlossom end rot | Black-brown spots at blossom end | Deep watering, add garden lime |\nBuckeye rot | Spots look like buckeyes | Avoid surface flooding |\nGray wall | Blotchy, mottled fruits | Good garden hygiene |\nLeaf mold | Pale yellow-green spots on leaves with gray velvety growth | Increase air circulation, water at soil line |\nTomato pith necrosis | Blackening stems and leaves, pith disintegrates | Water at soil line |\nDamping off | Seedlings fail to thrive outdoors | Plant seeds indoors, avoid nitrogen fertilizer |\nMosaic virus | Curling, mottled leaves | Preventive reflective mulch |\n- 01 of 17\nEarly Blight\nEarly blight, caused by Alternaria fungus, is the most common of several leaf spot diseases on tomatoes. Early blight is more prevalent in hot, humid regions and remains in the soil for one year. Wet weather can bring on an attack. In areas impacted by early blight, choose disease-resistant cultivars with Resistant to EB (Early Blight) labels.\nSymptoms: Dark brown spots encircled with rings start on the lowest leaves and move up, eventually causing foliage to shrivel, dry up, and fall. Lesions develop on stems and fruits. The defoliation causes sunscald.\nManagement: Remove lower leaves, including up to a third of the infected foliage. Apply a tomato fungicide at the first sign of infection or when weather conditions are favorable for the disease to develop. Do not compost affected plants.\nPrevent early blight by watering at the soil level and mulching. Keep adequate space between plants and rows; use stakes and practice good weed control. Prune bottom leaves from plants and rotate tomato plants and other nightshades every two years. Copper and/or sulfur sprays can prevent further development of the fungus.\n- 02 of 17\nFusarium or Verticillium Wilt\nFusarium wilt or verticillium wilt are confused with one another but they are both fungal diseases with similar issues.\n- Fusarium wilt is caused by Fusarium oxysporum.\n- Verticillium wilt is caused by Verticillium dahliae.\nSymptoms: In warm weather, the entire plant wilts down during the day, often recovering at night. Symptoms start on older, lower leaves and move upward. Eventually leaves on one side turn yellow, dry up, turn brown, and fall off. The inner tissue of the lower stem turns red or black. Plants may die quickly or succumb in a week or more.\nManagement: Treatment is similar for both types of wilt. There is no fungicide for wilt; remove and dispose of infected plants and roots. Fungus spores can remain in soil for many years, but this disease does not spread among plants grown in the same season.\nPrevent the diseases by planting resistant varieties labeled VFN or FN. Keep tools clean and practice a three-year crop rotation. Fusarium wilt is hosted by pigweed and crabgrass so weed control is important. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilizers which encourage disease.\n- 03 of 17\nPowdery Mildew\nPowdery mildew spreads by three different types of airborne fungi. The type of spore differs according to temperature but high humidity levels increase disease occurrence. Fruits do not develop powdery mildew but defoliation leads to sunscald and crop loss.\nSymptoms: Yellow spots appear on leaves turning to white powdery lesions coating the entire leaf and appearing on stems.\nManagement: Stop the spread of powdery mildew by treating the entire crop with with sulfur dust, fungicides, biofungicides, and horticultural oils. Remove infected leaves and buds.\nPrevent powdery mildew by allowing adequate space between plants. Prune tomato plants for good air circulation. Provide regular consistent hydration at soil level and avoid wetting leaves.\n- 04 of 17\nAnthracnose\nAnthracnose is a common fungal disease that causes fruit to rot. It's caused by Colletotrichum coccodes, a fungus that favors warm temperatures, wet conditions, and poorly-drained soil. The fungus is often splashed onto the fruit from the soil. It can also take hold on spots of early blight or dying leaves.\nOverripe tomatoes that come in contact with wet soil are especially susceptible. Dozens of weeds and other plants host this fungus which overwinters in soil and plant debris.\nSymptoms: Small, round, and sunken water-soaked spots appear on fruit and increase in concentric circles causing tomatoes to rot. Leaves may develop small, round spots with yellow halos. Infection starts in small immature fruits but symptoms don't appear until ripening.\nManagement: Copper sprays offer some resistance but these fungicides are more effective as a preventive measure. Apply tomato fungicide to your entire crop at the first sign of infection or when weather conditions are favorable for disease to take hold.\nPlant certified seeds in well-draining soil, remove the lower 12 inches of leaves to prevent contact with the soil, stake plants, mulch, practice good weed control, and water at the soil level. Avoid letting tomatoes overripen on the vine and dispose of rotten fruit and debris. Practice crop rotation every two years along with other nightshades.\nContinue to 5 of 17 below - 05 of 17\nSeptoria Leaf Spot\nThe Septoria fungus causes septoria leaf spot. The fungal infection affects leaves but not the fruit. It is sometimes mistaken for late blight. Insects, tools, and water spread fungus spores which remain in the soil for up to two years. This fungus thrives in warm, wet weather so watch for symptoms and act immediately.\nSymptoms: Symptoms are similar to early blight, but septoria more often appears at the first fruit set. This fungus appears on leaves as multiple small, dark, circles that enlarge to 1/3 to 1/4-inch in diameter. The spots develop a tan or gray center, and the leaves eventually wilt and fall off. It spreads rapidly causing loss of older leaves first, then infects new foliage, and can quickly move through an entire crop. Early leaf drop leads to fruit loss and sunscald.\nManagement: The most effective treatment is repeated applications with a tomato fungicide or biofungicide for the entire tomato crop. Copper sprays and Serenade fungicide are somewhat effective at halting the spread of symptoms. Remove infected leaves to prevent the spread of spores to other leaves, as water splashing on the leaves helps transmit the disease.\nGood garden sanitation is critical for preventing septoria leaf spot. Remove fallen leaves and debris from the garden immediately. Clean tools before and after working with plants, water at ground level, and control insect pests. Rotate your tomato crops every three years.\n- 06 of 17\nBotrytis Gray Mold\nBotrytis develops from the fungus Botrytis cinerea. Infection takes root in damaged stems or pruning cuts and can lie dormant for up to 12 weeks. Spores are spread by wind and water and are most prevalent in cooler temperatures. Tomato flowers are also susceptible to this fungus.\nSymptoms: Brown lesions show on leaves and stems. A whitish soft rot appears on fruits. The mold causes tomatoes to rot after harvest. Leaves die and fall off and stem girdling leads to wilt.\nManagement: Botrytis often dies back when temperatures rise. Treat widespread or persistent infection with tomato fungicide or biofungicide with a specific application for gray mold.\nPrevent botrytis by pruning plants in the early afternoon, which allows cuts to dry quickly. Avoid overhead watering and working with wet plants. Leave adequate spacing between plants and rows for good air circulation.\n- 07 of 17\nBacterial Speck\nBacterial speck is one of several bacterial problems that affect tomato plants by reducing yields. The bacteria Pseudomonas syringae causes bacterial speck during persistent cool, wet weather. Bacterial speck spreads by splashing water on the leaves. It can't be cured but there are steps to take to stop it from spreading.\nSymptoms: Yellow tissue surrounds small, irregular, dark brown to black spots close to leaf margins. Spots appear raised on mature fruit but they can also appear flat or sunken.\nManagement: Treat plants with a copper fungicide during cool, wet weather. Hot weather stops the pathogen from spreading.\nDelay planting until weather conditions are warmer and drier. Avoid overhead irrigation and rotate tomatoes and other nightshades every year.\n- 08 of 17\nSouthern Blight\nSouthern blight is caused by the soilborne fungus Athelia rolfsii which girdles the tomato stem and prevents the plant from taking up water and nutrients. More prevalent in southern regions, it favors high temperatures, moist conditions, and acidic soil. Southern blight persists in soil for years. It not only affects tomatoes, but it also impacts peppers, beans, cantaloupes, carrots, potatoes, watermelon, and peanuts, among others.\nSymptoms: Black-brown round lesions appear on stems near ground level and spread rapidly forming a white mold that produces sunken brown necrotic tissue. Plants wilt and fall over and fruits that contact the soil develop yellow spots that evolve into watersoaked lesions. Young plants may collapse at the soil line. Fruit near the stem can become infected, as well. Tomatoes rot within three to four days.\nManagement: Fungicides and biofungicides can help manage southern blight. Soil fumigants can be used but are expensive.\nPreventive steps include polarization to kill spores, crop rotation, and maintaining soil pH levels for tomatoes. Avoid planting during wet weather with expected high temperatures. Remove plant debris and till or disk soil several times before planting. Dispose of infected plants and plant debris but do not compost. Eliminate weeds and rotate tomatoes with non-host crops.\nContinue to 9 of 17 below - 09 of 17\nGray Leaf Spot\nGray leaf spot is a fungal disease that affects mainly the leaves of tomatoes, starting with the oldest leaves, although it can also infect the stems of the plant. It does not infect the fruit, although the disease can be harbored in the seeds of the infected plant.\nSymptoms: Small, dark spots with yellow halos appear on the top and bottom surfaces of the leaves. The spots enlarge and turn a grayish brown. Eventually, the centers of the spots crack and fall out. Surrounding leaf areas will turn yellow and the leaves dry out and drop. Fruit production is inhibited.\nManagement: Warm, moist conditions worsen gray leaf spot problems. Remove all affected plants and fall garden debris. Do not compost infected plants.\nCherry and grape tomato plants are most often impacted. Select resistant varieties. Rotate crops to avoid planting in infected soil.\n- 10 of 17\nLate Blight\nLate blight is a mold disease affecting the leaves, stems, and fruit. It develops in cool, wet weather and spreads rapidly. Late blight is caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans, which is not a true fungus but still causes devastation as it did during the Irish potato famine in the 1840s. If you suspect you have late blight, contact your local extension service for specific identification because there are many strains of late blight.\nSymptoms: Greasy-looking, irregularly shaped dark brown blotches with green-gray edges appear on leaves. A ring of white mold develops around the spots, especially in wet weather. The spots eventually turn dry and papery. Blackened areas may appear on the stems. The fruit also develops large, irregularly shaped, greasy gray spots and can turn mushy from a secondary bacterial infection.\nManagement: Copper sprays offer some control. The fungicide Serenade works best as a deterrent rather than a cure. Late blight can overwinter in soil, potato debris, and seeds, even in colder areas. Remove all debris and don't save seed potatoes. Rotate crops to prevent infections the following year.\n- 11 of 17\nBlossom End Rot\nBlossom end rot is generally attributed to a lack of calcium availability during fruit set. This could be caused by too much high-nitrogen fertilizer or uneven watering, resulting in fluctuations in nutrient availability. It's a physiological disorder, not a disease, but it still results in fruit loss.\nSymptoms: Dark brown or black spots develop at the blossom end of the fruit and enlarge as the fruit rots. The spots look water-soaked.\nManagement: Remove affected fruit and provide regular, deep waterings. Add garden lime to the soil to help plants uptake water and nutrients. Use a fertilizer low in nitrogen and high in phosphorous.\n- 12 of 17\nBuckeye Rot\nBuckeye rot is more common in Southern states, especially during warm, wet periods. Buckeye rot affects both green and ripe fruit.\nSymptoms: A small brown spot will enlarge and develop concentric rings resembling a buckeye. The affected area may appear round or oblong, and the firm lesion with smooth margins becomes soft and decayed as the disease progresses.\nManagement: Remove affected fruit. Avoid surface water from flooding the plants. Keep future fruits from making contact with the soil.\nContinue to 13 of 17 below - 13 of 17\nGray Wall\nGray wall is essentially a ripening problem. There's no known associated pathogen or treatment, only preventive steps. Cool temperatures and stressed or unhealthy plants contribute to the problem.\nSymptoms: The green fruits may have a gray cast or flattened, gray blotches. Ripe fruit has a mottled appearance and green or brown areas on the inside of the fruit.\nManagement: Good growing conditions help prevent gray wall. Make sure plants are not heavily shaded. Evenly water and regularly fertilize plants. Keep the soil from becoming compacted around the roots.\n- 14 of 17\nLeaf Mold\nLeaf mold is a fungus caused by Passalora fulva and it occurs most frequently in humid conditions.\nSymptoms: Leaf mold appears as pale green or yellowish spots on the upper leaves. When it's very humid, the spots occur on the bottom surfaces of the leaves and then become covered in a gray, velvety growth of fungal spores. Fruits can have a leathery, blackish rot near the stem.\nManagement: Increase air circulation by pruning, spacing, and staking tomato plants to control the disease. Avoid watering overhead to keep leaves dry.\nCrop rotation is important and use a preventive fungicide.\n- 15 of 17\nTomato Pith Necrosis\nTomato pith necrosis is a disease caused by soil-borne Pseudomonas bacteria. It occurs during cloudy, cool, and moist conditions.\nSymptoms: An early symptom is the blackening of the stems and leaves. Later symptoms involve split stems or stems that shrink and crack. The pith (stem interior) disintegrates and becomes hollow, disrupting water flow, and causing yellowing leaves.\nManagement: Warmer weather can resolve the issue. But to manage the disease, do not water from above, keep soil adequately moist, and remove and dispose of dead and diseased plants and roots.\nSince the bacteria can remain in the soil for a few years, it's best to rotate crops.\n- 16 of 17\nDamping Off\nDamping off is a fungal disease caused by Rhizoctonia that affects tomato plant seedlings. This fungus develops in cool, wet, and rich soils.\nSymptoms: Seedlings may fail to emerge or the stems are water-soaked.\nManagement: When planting tomatoes, plant seeds indoors and do not put them in soil with high nitrogen levels. Add nitrogen fertilizer after seedlings are more established, which is when they have their first true leaves. It's always good practice to keep the surface of the soil dry between waterings.\nContinue to 17 of 17 below - 17 of 17\nMosaic Virus\nMosaic virus is transmitted in many ways, including seed, grafting, pests, or handling by human hands. The virus is a concern throughout the growing season. It's also a difficult virus to eradicate since it survives in plant debris for over 50 years.\nSymptoms: Curling leaves may become mottled, new leaflets are small, and infected fruit is brown inside. Growth can be generally light in color. The fruit may have a mottled mosaic look (alternating colors) on the skin.\nManagement: Control of mosaic virus is difficult. Reflective mulches may help prevent the problem.\n-\nHow do I identify a tomato disease?\nThere are many symptoms but typically a tomato disease can be identified by yellowing or dark spots on leaves that occur after or during a wet or cool season.\n-\nHow do you save a diseased tomato plant?\nYou can try to save a diseased tomato plant with the proper treatment, including pruning, fungicide, or horticultural remedies. Not all diseased tomato plants can be saved.\n-\nWhat does tomato blight look like on a tomato?\nSouthern blight and late blight cause fruits to turn brown and rot. Early blight causes sunscald on tomatoes due to the exfoliation of leaves."
